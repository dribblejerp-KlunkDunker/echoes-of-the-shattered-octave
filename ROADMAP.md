# Echoes of the Shattered Octave — Master Roadmap

This document tracks the full evolution of **Echoes of the Shattered Octave — Book One: The Silenced Province**, from the completed hand-painted 26-enemy animation pass and Daggerfall-style regional travel maps through the ten highest-impact upgrades and all nine domain expansions (World & Exploration, Combat, Character & Progression, Items & Economy, Quests & Story, Companions, Audio, Visuals, Interface & QoL, and Technical).

---

## Release road: Book One, ready to sell (from 27 October 2026)

This is the authoritative order of work before the game goes on sale. It comes from `story/Game Layer/Release Readiness - length, areas and enrichment.md`, which has the evidence and file references for every line. `[ ]` means not started, `[~]` partial, `[x]` done and verified. Each milestone ships as its own tested PR or PRs, and each must pass its gate before the next starts.

**Where the game stands.**
- **Length (estimated from the code, not played):** main story 3–4.5 h, with all side quests 14–20 h, completionist 19–27 h.
- **Maps:** 41 in the main game, 9 in the extras.
- **Areas:** about 6 more fit inside Book One's region, 8 at most.

### R1 — Release blockers: bugs and promises
Gate: every fix has a regression test; the full test suite passes; a playthrough of Parts 2→3→4 hits none of these.
- [ ] **Story-breaking route.**
  - In Parts 3 and 4, the Whisper-Grove and Deep Woods noticeboards offer "Enter Your House on Cooper's Row". Its door leads to Oakhaven, where the mast replays the Part Two ending (upgrades.js:856, 1256–1262; game.js:1555–1564).
  - Hide the house after Part 3 starts, and guard the mast trigger.
- [ ] **Point-of-no-return warning.**
  - A one-time confirmation before the shaft sets `rite_started` (game.js:209), listing the Oakhaven quests still open.
  - Part 3's mast ladder already does this (grove.js:180–190).
- [ ] **Close the six Sheep-Walk and Hanger quests** at the Greening, with closing logbook lines (sheepwalk22.js:780–809, 1331; hanger22.js:605–682).
- [ ] **Log optional quests as side quests,** not main: Lanterns in the Mist, Ignatius, the grey folder, Kaelen telling Lyra (wilds.js:109, 117, 133; data.js:509, 684, 980; grove.js:242).
- [ ] **Year 417:** the board says the cairn is "near the culvert", but it stands at the west edge of the clearing (upgrades.js:855, 1250).
- [ ] **The Red Cloak dead-ends** when Sable isn't travelling with you (data.js:1001–1003).
- [ ] **Small things:**
  - "the Boar & Bell" should be "the Boar & Dulcimer" (game.js:696).
  - Remove the duplicate Harrow branch (data.js:338).
  - Give the six write-only flags a consequence, or remove them: `halder_told`, `herald_answered`, `aegis_how`, `hymn_read`, `party_plan`, `cat_met`.
  - Warn before the Last Sheaf and the Eel-Run can be missed.
- [ ] **Documents match the game.**
  - The README's strongbox count is 26, not 13.
  - The domain roadmap below now marks what isn't built; build those features or keep them off the store page.

### R2 — Canon sweep
Gate: each change checked against the Series Bible and Book One; French entries updated; story-i18n test green.
- [ ] **The Boar & Dulcimer keeps its own rules** (NO SINGING, NO DICE):
  - The evening set becomes a Narrow performance with silent applause.
  - The dice game moves to the cellar.
  - Files: tavern11.js; Book One ch. 4.
- [ ] **The Legionnaires' dying names** use invented names only. Drop Joss Carder, Emory Wain, Wren Halloway, Annet Sowerby and Merret Salt (data.js:231).
- [ ] **The Cloister's name-tapes** follow canon's list in ch. 20: Orry, Ben Dray, A. SOWERBY and the others. Drop Elsie Fenn (data.js:637).
- [ ] **The lore books:**
  - "On the Eight Anchors": wrong Hz and Anchors (upgrades.js:715).
  - The Veil's absorption: c. 300 SR (upgrades.js:727).
  - The 417 register: the Pellow child, in spring (upgrades.js:719).
  - Use the canon skipping rhyme (upgrades.js:732).
- [ ] **Tobin's journal pages 10–12** are dated after he was taken (tobin.js:109–124).
- [ ] **Tobin's Tuning-Blade cairn becomes his lyre by the stile.** Add his seven oiled reed-pipes in Lyra's house (upgrades.js:1311–1319; ch. 1).
- [ ] **The heist's quarry lease is Aldric's signature,** not Mossbrook's (heist16.js:309, 401).
- [ ] **Ignatius gives once and does not run a shop;** the stock moves to the sexton (data.js:606–610).
- [ ] **The Mausoleum is the old house of the Silent Veil,** not a tomb of "Cantors of Memory" (data.js:893).
- [ ] **The Tanner twins:** reconcile them with "sung into the ground side by side", and rename them off Joss (data.js:322, 484).
- [ ] **The Hall of Carriage is at the Organum** (Sable's party chat).
- [ ] **Lyra does not sing before her voice returns** (party.js:17, 187). See R3's voiceless kit.
- [ ] **Smaller fixes:**
  - The Hedge's hound-bed line (companion-talk.js:215).
  - Tobin quoting Lyra's line (companion-talk.js:266).
  - The noticeboard's public proctor bounty (upgrades.js:851).
  - Mutton on every menu in a starving town.
- [ ] **Near-collisions:** Pellam Dree and Pellam Quist; Wenna Marl and Abbess Wenna; Annet Sorrel and Annet Sowerby.
- [ ] **Reedcraft's "wind-reeds" become Flume-reeds** (reedcraft.js:54). Real wind-reeds died in 412.

### R3 — The Narrow comes home: make existing systems matter
Gate: tests per system; a recorded playtest note that Oakhaven feels tense but fair.
- [ ] **Hush-lamps hold off the Hush.** A lamp's radius stops the stillness timer, and a hush-whistle plants a temporary lamp outdoors (game.js:304; maps.js:329).
- [ ] **The Narrow as law inside the Hedge.**
  - Loud noise gets the ward-sign and a hush from witnesses.
  - A repeat is a "breach of the Narrow" fine through `reportCrime`.
- [ ] **Songs learned from people.**
  - Lyra: the Root note.
  - Tam: "The Miller's Daughter".
  - Bettany or Ilse: the tending breath.
  - Tobin's notebook: the falling fifth.
  - Built on ledger15 training and Hold the Pitch.
- [ ] **Lyra's voiceless kit before `lyra_voice`.** Whistle the falling fifth to stun or aim; the tending breath gives a small heal.
- [ ] **Hound packs with a leader.** A falling fifth on the leader routs the pack.
- [ ] **Three canon combat rules:**
  - Fear raises your noise below 30% health.
  - Quiets go to a lit lantern.
  - A hound's burst leaves a dead patch where nothing carries.
- [ ] **The dusk Listening Hour.** Lamplighters, night-hummers at the crossings, and the dead-hour call.
- [ ] **Faction standing (canon's Concordance)** fed by choices already made. It moves only prices, a line from Harrow and from Hetty, and one ending line. No numbers on screen.

### R4 — Fill the thin places
Gate: every listed map has people, something to use, and a reason to be there; screenshots of each.
- [ ] **The Watch Downs:** currently empty. People and props, danger stays 0 (Author Rulings 93–95).
- [ ] **Wethercombe and the Bellwether:** 4 people. Farmsteads open, the inn usable, and the "no sheep" line given a speaker.
- [ ] **The Flume Road:** no people. Ennis Crowle the beekeeper, tied to Telling the Bees.
- [ ] **The tannery:** no people. Opens onto the Hollow (R5).
- [ ] **The Low Rings and Stillwater Landing:** people and trade fit for a "smugglers' town".
- [ ] **Oakhaven's barred doors:** 21 of 34. Open the baker's and chandler's interiors, which the roadmap claims but whose doors are still barred.
- [ ] **Small Oakhaven life:**
  - The iron-oaks chime in the wind.
  - The morning sapling with a hand-saw beside it.
  - The baker's wife punching dough down all night.
  - The sexton salting graves.
  - The daily tanker-wagon.
  - Dogs howling at noon.
- [ ] **Named NPCs keep daily routines,** not just the 6 generic townsfolk.

### R5 — New areas inside Book One (6 planned, 8 at most)
Gate: each joins a map that is already reachable, keeps the Hedge rule, closes cleanly at the Greening or the Kestrel's departure, and has French and tests.
- [ ] 1. **The Hollow,** behind the tannery. The burl-sick ward, the Grafters' visit, Lissa Merrow.
- [ ] 2. **The Carders' house and root-cellar.** The design doc's Hush-Mite tutorial; Pim and Nell.
- [ ] 3. **The Moot-house in Whisper-Grove.** Sable's gallery.
- [ ] 4. **The Bell Yard and Ashlane,** one map. Halder Wick's and Ivo Renn's homes; names for the Ledger.
- [ ] 5. **The Governor's house.** The aired room; Aldric's hidden roots.
- [ ] 6. **The standing-stone ring.** Next in line per the Author Rulings; its contents marked [PROPOSED].
- [ ] 7. *(optional)* **The Reedside Conservatory and reed orchard,** with Ilse Brennan. The old stair stays sealed.
- [ ] 8. *(optional, highest risk)* **The Deep Grove.**

### R6 — Lore and quests, chosen by playtest
Gate: owner picks from this list after the R1–R4 playtest; nothing here is required to sell.
- [ ] **Book One's 24 unused epigraphs placed as documents in the world.** For example: the Grafting Office handbook, K. Vance on calibration, Catalogue Circular 12, the crates' bill of lading, the Warrant of Purification, the Rubric of the Rite.
- [ ] **The Madder birth on day 0,** using Hold the Pitch.
- [ ] **Lissa Merrow; Ilse Brennan** as the voiceless song-teacher.
- [ ] **NPCs notice your calling:** Vosk, Ignatius, Vane, Bettany, Tobiah.
- [ ] **Pay the ledger off:** names on the Kestrel's deck-beam, candles at Canopy, real dates in ledger rows.
- [ ] **An Echo card if you answered the Hedge.** Hew Callan remembers. Vane's long gun and his pistols.
- [ ] **A "Listen" verb for the glassed calling.** "Who holds the line tonight?" at the Part Four camp.
- [ ] **Let the nine days count.** The Grafters on Rootday and the Church on Dawnday, missable without failing anything.
- [ ] **Recurring voices you can't see,** a gentle version on by default. Hounds circling the camp fire.
- [ ] **The Pure Note drone from `rite_ready`.** Famine graves.
- [ ] **Dialect and feast talk:** off-reed, growing, Candlefast, rumours of the Weighing. One residue encounter answered by tone.

### R7 — Release preparation
Gate: the owner signs off.
- [ ] **A full human playtest on real hardware,** in English and French. Feel, pacing, difficulty, loudness and timing can't be judged headless.
- [ ] **Finish the remaining drawn stand-ins:**
  - The third grass tuft and the second reed.
  - Posters two and three.
  - The second Synod notice.

  A Canva batch is scheduled. Optional afterwards: 128-pixel textures, which only show on High and above.
- [ ] **Performance check** on a low-end laptop and a phone.
- [ ] **Saves:** saves from earlier builds still load.
- [ ] **Store copy written only from verified features,** with screenshots taken from the real build.
- [ ] **Credits and licences re-checked:** CREDITS.md and ASSETS.md.

**Avoid as bloat:**
- More minigames, generic systems, new regions, currencies or crafting trees.
- Companions beyond canon.
- Faction numbers on screen.
- Hard timers that fail quests.
- Book Two content outside the extras.

## Next expansion: art, animation, simulation and tools

The checklist below is the authoritative scope for the new request. The older completed checklists later in this document describe the previous baseline, **not** completion of these enhanced versions. `[~]` means a partial implementation or pilot; `[x]` requires implementation and verification. No production republish is included.

### Delivery order and gates
The 94 unfinished checklist items at the start of this plan (85 not started, 9 partial) are grouped once below; counts include partial work, not equal-sized implementation tasks. The visual identity, combat, crime, traps, physical puzzles and pickpocketing pilots already delivered remain the baseline. Each phase is delivered in tested milestones, not one oversized rewrite.

| Phase | Scope / checklist ownership | Starting remaining | Delivery milestones |
|---|---|---:|---|
| 1 — Stealth, law & gameplay | Gameplay | 11 | **Delivered: throwable distractions + investigation** → **Delivered: body hiding/discovery** → **Delivered: disguises/inspection** → **Delivered: broader crime/wanted posters/prison** → **Delivered: bribes/threats at the watch** → **Delivered: horse rental + travel modifiers** → **Delivered: optional hunger/sleep** → **Delivered: opt-in hardcore runs** → Phase 1 complete; next is phase 2, the spatial world. Directional sound feedback depends on phase 7 audio. |

Phase 1 acceptance for this pass: separate consumable stones and empty bottles (never the story Vox-Bottle); collision-clipped forward impact with readable feedback; idle guards and non-boss enemies investigate the impact, never abandon a visible wanted player or active combat; keyboard/touch/controller input; inventory save compatibility; transient sound targets cannot replay after load. No external services, production deployment, or Git delivery is included.

Body-handling acceptance for this pass: settled physical corpses can be dragged slowly with collision/line-of-sight clipping, dropped and concealed/recovered at marked nonblocking shrouded recesses. G / touch Body / controller left-stick opens a no-cost action panel; keyboard, touch and controller actions work. Visible bodies trigger one patrol alarm, drawing nearby idle allies to the body without revealing an unseen player or overriding combat. A constable witnessing an active drag can add one bounty. Hiding prevents discovery; loot and kill rewards remain independent. Bodies, concealment and alarms retain the existing current-visit-only lifecycle, cleared on departure/load/death as appropriate; dead enemies and loot still save normally. No Git delivery, deployment or external services are included.

Disguise acceptance for this pass: equip purchasable Synod clerk robes through existing armour inventory or Y/touch status/controller Back actions. Ordinary non-boss Proctors and Legionnaires ignore a covered traveller at a distance but inspect within 2.4 units of clear sight, exposing them after three cumulative seconds (twice as fast at noise 4+). Backing away/occlusion reduces suspicion. Witnessed attacks, loud/offensive Songs, throws, body dragging and changing into robes expose cover locally. Active combat, body-alarm searches, monsters/bosses, story locks and Oakhaven bounty enforcement are never bypassed. Exposure persists per area in existing saved flags; transient inspection does not. Written percentage/status feedback, inventory paper doll, keyboard/touch/controller flow, old-save and hostile-import regressions are required. Push verified milestone changes to a feature branch; no automatic merge or deployment.

Law/prison acceptance for this pass: expand Oakhaven jurisdiction to its inhabited interiors with explicitly owned non-quest goods and nonlethal civilian assault (40 bounty; four-second per-target reporting cooldown). Witnessed theft stays 20; witnesses require live, unstunned NPCs, sight and facing (constables always notice). Constables pursue visible offenders and search their last seen position without tracking through walls. Two world notices show current player/bounty at 40+, withdrawing after settlement. Arrest offers exact checked payment, refusal/grace, or a playable six-hour watch-house sentence. Non-quest inventory, ordinary weapons/armour and ammunition enter validated saved evidence escrow; quest items and innate weapons remain safe. Serve/pay for release and automatic gear return, or use existing mechanical lockpicking to reach evidence and escape; escape adds 60 once and leaves the fine outstanding. Re-arrest must preserve unrecovered evidence. Save/load, older saves, hostile imports, duplicate/stale actions, keyboard/touch/simulated-controller input, compact panels and story/loot compatibility require automated checks. Commit and push a feature branch; no merge or deployment.

Phase 2 requires per-pixel depth, camera elevation, collision and picking to agree; do not bolt height onto the existing single-depth-per-column renderer. Existing art pilots do not constitute finished hand-painted action sheets. Accessibility, save compatibility and security checks apply during every phase, not only phase 7.

Every phase must retain the security regression tests and save/load behavior. Rendering changes need browser screenshots (day/night, indoor/outdoor, near/far), representative frame-time measurements before performance claims, and keyboard/touch/gamepad regression checks. Target low-end presets only after measurements on representative hardware; do not promise Chromebook frame rates from a server benchmark.

### Graphics — 3D view
- [x] Five-angle enemies: front/front-side/side/back-side/back, mirror opposite views. Phase 20 replaced `js/directions.js`'s squeezed stand-ins with hand-built views for every species, each cut from the species' own painting, turned on a rig and re-lit (`js/bestiary20a.js`, `js/bestiary20b.js`; swarm, hush-moth and horn stay symmetric by design); Phase 25 snaps them to the four sides the owner asked for (front, left, back, right), and rigs the Proctor, the companions and every named person the same way (`js/people25.js`).
- [~] Horizon country: layered hill, mountain-range and cliff-shoulder silhouettes per outdoor map, with lumpy crests, snow caps, a sun and moon that cross the sky, drawn cloud cover and per-layer aerial perspective. The distant ridges are still scenery you cannot reach; near country is now real ground (see the next item). The fixed-bearing Chapel spire-line and Mausoleum-tower silhouettes were retired once those buildings became real geometry.
- [~] Walkable hills, mountains and cliff faces: cell heights (`map.lvls`) plus sloped ground from corner heights (`map.verts`/`map.smooth`, shaped with `hill()`, `ramp()` and crag `steep` flanks). Feet follow a slope continuously; a slope steeper than 1.1 rise per run (`MAX_GRADE`) cannot be climbed; coming down a rock face is a tumble scored at 12 health per unit past 0.9 (a sheer drop stays 26). Authored: the Deep Woods' Mausoleum rise, willow hill, west knoll and crag; the clearing's south-west rise; the Watch-stone. Picking, sprites and the automap agree with height. Phase 20 and 22 made the Watch Downs and Wethercombe walkable country beyond the walls. **Still to do: the Grey Teeth stay silhouettes, and pathing that also routes around solid props (enemies route around crags and terraces with `js/pathing.js`, but not around trees and crates).**
- [x] Variable-height low walls, tall towers and stepped rooftops; correct occlusion behind low walls: a cell's absolute top (`c.top`, helpers `block()`/`lowWall()`) is drawn as a face plus a visible cap when below the eye, and rays keep walking past tall faces while anything taller could still show. Occlusion is a per-pixel depth buffer, not two faces per column. Authored: Oakhaven's stepped roofline on every building, the Chapel bell-tower, Greenhall dome, mooring mast, knee-high bell-plinth and bridge parapets; the clearing's dry-stone field wall; the Mausoleum's stepped roof and tower. Verified: a figure behind the field wall shows above the cap and leaks no pixels below it. Rooftops and upper storeys are scenery, not floors you can walk.
- [x] Stairs, ramps, raised platforms: the Watch-stone stair, the timber hound-watch stand, the Bell-Tower's six-step timber stair to a railed 1.8 gallery beside the great bell (with an open edge you can fall from) under a 3.3 ceiling, and the Quarry depot's 1.2 terrace reached by an authored `ramp()` at grade 0.4. Verified in `test/traversal.test.js`: continuous climbs, railings refuse you, edges hurt, saves restore your height, every usable object stays reachable.
- [x] Painted Cloister ceilings, tavern beams and cave rock ceilings: per-cell ceiling textures (`map.ceilCells`): timber beams over smoke-stained plaster in every timber interior, a ribbed lilac-and-gold vault in the Cloister and Chapel, rough rock in the quarry, caves and dungeons (`js/ceilings.js`, `GFX.ceilings`). Phase 20 replaced the procedural stand-ins with three hand-built 64x64 pixel-art tiles.
- [x] Sky: sun and moon with dawn/dusk glow, weather-driven clouds, a sky that grades by hour; night stars that turn with the view and hide under cloud, area panoramas behind the ridges for each outdoor map, and the Drift-Kestrel crossing the Whisper-Grove and Deep Woods skies on a schedule (`js/sky.js`). Phase 20 redrew the panoramas (with the landmark ridges baked in) and the flyover ship as hand-built pixel art.
- [x] Water sky/building reflections and step-driven ripples: screen-space reflections on every water and shallows pixel (sky, walls and sprites mirrored about the waterline, faded by distance and angle), and expanding world-space rings from your footsteps and from wading NPCs and enemies (`js/water.js`, `GFX.reflections`). Works on every map with water.
- [x] Light-glass emissive highlights and nearby wall light: lights no longer shine through walls (per-light visibility masks, still carried over knee-high walls), and emissive masks make Kaelen's glass arm, shards, glass lamps and flames render at full brightness in the dark (`js/lighting.js`, `GFX.emissive`). The engine marks those pixels as glow so bloom lights only real lights.
- [x] Ground-hugging mist and darkness: weather mist plus permanent area mist in Whisper-Grove, the Deep Woods, the catacombs, the Mausoleum, the belfry and the clearing at night (`js/post.js`); torch-driven interiors — rooms are dark away from their lamps and hearths, and the lantern (U) lights the floor around you indoors and outdoors at night (`js/lighting.js`, `GFX.darkInteriors`).
- [~] Higher-detail close-up wall artwork with asset-resolution and memory budgets: a close-range grain (stone grit and wood fibre) modulates walls within 2.5 units (`Engine.setDetail`), and every generated texture is counted against a 512 KB budget (256 KB used, pinned by `test/surfaces.test.js`). **Hand-made close-up art and resolution tiers pending.**
- [~] Moss, cracks, scorch marks, posters and Synod notices as seeded wall detail layers: twelve decals placed deterministically per map: posters and Synod notices on Oakhaven walls by the cobbles (more by the Chapel and Greenhall), moss outdoors and in damp places, scorch in the quarry and dungeons, cracks in stone interiors (`js/decals.js`, `GFX.decals`). Phase 20b painted a wall notice, a Synod notice and a moss patch (`img/painted20/`); the other two mosses, both cracks and both scorch marks are rendered by Blender from procedural materials (`tools/art/decals/marks.py`, October 2026). **Still drawn stand-ins: the other two posters and the second Synod notice.**
- [x] More barrels, crates, carts, broken statues, graves and bones, placed without blocking routes: props in Oakhaven, the clearing, the quarry, the Deep Woods, Whisper-Grove and the catacombs, each accepted only if a flood fill still reaches every door, portal, NPC, item and usable object, kept 1.6 from doors and off the roads (`js/scenery.js`). Transient: never saved, rebuilt on load. Phase 20b painted the barrel, crate, hand-cart, broken cart, broken statue and bones, the open and side barrels followed in October 2026, and every painted prop now keeps its stand-in's dithered contact shadow so it stands on the ground; Phase 25 gives the props depth; the second statue and the fallen stone head were painted in October 2026, so no drawn prop stand-ins remain.
- [~] Swaying, player-reactive grass and reeds: up to 120 tufts per outdoor map, reeds along banks and shallows, swaying with the weather's wind and bending away from you (more when running) (`js/flora.js`, `GFX.grass`). Phase 20b painted two grass tufts and a reed. **Still drawn stand-ins: the third tuft and the second reed.**
- [x] Geographic landmark placement: the Mausoleum's tower is real geometry on a rise, seen across the Deep Woods from wherever you stand, and the Oakhaven Chapel has a real bell-tower over the town. Phase 20 draws Oakhaven, Chapel and all, past the Hedge from the clearing and the Watch Downs (`js/horizon20.js`).
- [~] Modern look baseline: a 2x internal render resolution (640x300) with sharp or smooth upscaling, softer depth-graded fog, bloom on lamps, glass and fire, and per-area, per-hour colour grades are done (`Engine.setScale`, `js/post.js`, `js/presets.js`). **Higher-detail wall artwork at close range is a procedural stand-in (see above).**
- [x] Original/Low/Medium/High presets for resolution, view distance, particles and effects, measured per preset before choosing the default (Medium: 1x with every effect on). Options → Graphics & access holds the presets and each setting (`js/presets.js`). See the Phase 2 completion verification for the measured table.
- [x] Refine optional CRT scanlines and curvature; retain a clean unfiltered setting: fine scanlines and a vignette, an optional curvature illusion that keeps clicks exact, and a clean setting (CRT off, sharp pixels).

### Graphics — menus and screens
- [~] Carved walnut frames with brass corners on every panel, the title menu, character creation, events, death and ending screens, and the HUD bar (clear of every button, gauge and hit box) (`js/frames.js`). Procedural stand-in; the intro scroll and loading bar keep their old look.
- [~] Equipment-linked paper doll: armour layers with shaded cloth, leather, mail and plate, the selected weapon and shield shown with their icons, equip/remove controls preserved (`js/icons.js`). Final painted character/gear sheets pending.
- [x] An icon for every item (weapons, armour, potions, herbs, valuables and all 21 quest items, each distinct) in the inventory, shops, the house chest, the forge and brewing (`js/icons.js`). Phase 20 gave every catalog id its own hand-built 24x24 pixel drawing; the Phase 5 procedural kinds stay only as the fallback for ids added later without one, and for the paper doll's layers.
- [~] Angry, sad, afraid and wry portraits for Kaelen, Lyra and 18 other major characters, chosen from what each line says and the tone you chose, never changing dialogue or flags (`js/portraits.js`). Stand-in: colour grades and soft shading of the existing portraits, not repainted expressions.
- [~] An ink sketch beside each storyline in the logbook: 38 subjects, and every journal entry in the game maps to one (`js/logmap.js`). Procedural stand-in.
- [~] A painted card for each area family (street, hearth, hall, mill, chapel, Hedge, quarry, roots, grove, woods, crypt, belfry, arena...) appears during the existing half-second fade when you enter a new area; any input dismisses it and it never delays play (`js/screens.js`). Procedural stand-in built partly from the game's own paintings.
- [~] The death screen shows a picture for what killed you (falls, drowning, traps, bolts, the Heartglass, the Unwriting, the Greening, and each enemy family from the game's own sprites) behind the unchanged text. Procedural stand-in.
- [~] Each ending variant (three for Part Two, five for Book One, plus a glassed overlay) gets its own full-screen picture built on the ending painting, with alt text. Procedural stand-in.
- [x] Fonts are bundled with the game (`fonts/`, `css/fonts.css`), so it needs no network for type: Cinzel, Alegreya and Alegreya SC (previously loaded from Google Fonts) and UnifrakturMaguntia blackletter for titles and panel headings; body text stays Alegreya. All are SIL Open Font License 1.1 with their licence texts, and a Credits panel in Graphics & access names them.
- [~] The automap stamps doors and portals, quest givers (follows the Quest markers option), shops, enemies, bosses and unsprung traps, only in places you have walked, with a legend (`js/logmap.js`). Procedural stand-in.

### Animation — enemies and creatures
- [~] Hit-flinch frames for every enemy: the figure recoils away from the blow with a smear and a struck-edge highlight; swarms burst and scatter. Built once per species/pose/view and cached (`js/enemy-fx.js`). Procedural stand-in; hand-painted flinch sheets pending.
- [~] Three cached collapse poses generated from existing artwork; solid bodies persist until area departure, nonblocking/unpickable and excluded from saves. Browser lifecycle checks cover all 26 species. Bespoke hand-painted death sheets remain pending.
- [~] Species-specific idle fidgets: swaying robes, sniffing hounds, Quiet head turns and more, by family (`js/creature-life.js`). Procedural motion on existing art; painted idle sheets pending.
- [~] Detection startle on the same tick as the alert sound: a turn toward the player when heard, a jolt when seen. Procedural stand-in.
- [~] Separate fleeing and charging strides (lean, cadence, bounce). Procedural stand-in.
- [~] Pressman Mallow and the Deacon raise their arms and build a coloured glow for a fixed lead before the original effect lands; stun, death or losing the target cancels it, and stepping out of range dodges it. Damage, chances and cooldowns unchanged (`js/telegraphs.js`). Stand-in glow; painted casting poses pending.
- [~] The Requiem cracks and throws shards at half health, then fights on cracked; the Brood-Mother sheds her egg-sacs and fights on deflated. Procedural stand-in; painted phase art pending.
- [x] Drowned Hollow sinking deaths on water/shallow-water floors; dry-land Hollows collapse and leave bodies. Verified clipping/fade, termination and dry-floor behavior in Chromium.
- [x] Swarm/Hush-Moth outward-scattering deaths using cached radial pixel fragments, fading without a corpse. Both species verified in Chromium.
- [~] Enemies that appear mid-play get an entrance (earth rising, a thread from the ceiling, or a mist puff); the spot is checked collision-safe first and the enemy is harmless and non-solid until it lands. Saves taken during an entrance record it as solid. Procedural stand-in.

### Animation — companions and NPCs
- [~] Kaelen and Lyra flinch when hit, stoop from 60% health and limp when badly hurt (`js/companions.js`). Procedural stand-in; painted frames pending.
- [~] Below 35% health Kaelen holds his chest and a 174 Hz Root-note hum rises (`Audio_.hum`); one ramp drives both, so they start and stop together, and both stop when he recovers, is downed, the map changes or play pauses. Stand-in pose repainted from his art.
- [~] Faint rings spread from Lyra while she sings (tending and the Calling-Song), hidden by walls and nearer figures; Particles scales them, reduced motion shows one still ring. Stand-in.
- [~] Kaelen sharpens his blade at the Deepwoods camp and his hut (three strokes and a small spark that No flashes removes); people standing by a fire lean in and rub their hands. Stand-in motion on existing art.
- [~] Townsfolk gesture and turn their heads toward you while talking, and glance at you when you come close (`js/townsfolk.js`). Stand-in motion.
- [x] Six Oakhaven townsfolk work by day, three go to the Boar in the evening and all go home at night. Who is out is worked out from the clock and flags after every load, rest, prison stay and journey, never saved separately; every quest-bearing NPC is present at every hour (checked in quarter-hour steps), and changes in view wait for you to look away.
- [~] Crows peck and take wing, rats scurry for dark corners and the Whisper-Grove cat walks and darts, all fleeing further when you run (`js/smalllife.js`). They never block a path and are never witnesses, targets or saved. Procedural stand-in sprites.
- [~] Hetty wipes the bar and pours, Hob Wendle scrapes a hide, and Nell and Pim card and sort wool at the mill (the game has no miller); each pauses while you talk to them. Stand-in motion.

### Animation — first person
- [~] Weapon-family wind-up/strike/recovery choreography across all 16 catalog weapons, using existing first-person images with grip-pivot rotation/translation/scale. Bespoke multi-frame painted swing sheets remain pending.
- [~] Mace/maul/axe overhead arcs, knife/spear thrusts, mirrored blade sweeps and ranged recoil implemented and verified. No staff exists in the current weapon catalog; staff artwork/moves remain pending.
- [~] Draw, holster and weapon-switch transitions; an attack or Song mid-switch snaps the weapon ready, so combat timing is unchanged (`js/fp-hands.js`). Stand-in hands tinted from the existing art.
- [~] Raised hands and Song-coloured casting glow. Stand-in art.
- [x] Optional gentle head bob (Options → Head bob: Off/Gentle; the original bob stays the default) and a landing dip scaled by the drop (`js/fp-feel.js`).
- [x] Heavy-hit shake (one tick costing 18%+ of health), deafness blur with a grey rim, and the Hushed grey-out; deafness and the Hush also muffle all sound through a master low-pass, with written cues. Reduce motion (follows the OS setting) removes shake, dip and bob; No flashes removes hit, glass, Song and lightning flashes.
- [~] Doors swing on a hinge away from whoever opened them, chest lids lift and levers pull; collision, locks and thresholds unchanged (`js/doors.js`). Stand-in frames cut from the existing sprites.
- [~] Climbing hands reach and pull in time with the climb. Stand-in art.
- [x] Books, letters, logs, registers, writs and inscriptions open as a full-screen sheet with large high-contrast text, paging by keyboard, touch and controller, and a text-size control; dialogue and story choices keep the normal panel (`js/reading.js`).

### Animation — world
- [~] Campfire/hearth sprites now use four cached, distinct flame silhouettes generated from their existing painted warm-colour pixels; logs/stone remain anchored. Phase 4 added procedural wall torches and braziers with animated flames, glow and light (32 placed in dungeons and dark interiors, never blocking a path). Bespoke drawn fire sheets remain pending.
- [~] Smoke rises from sixteen Oakhaven chimneys, the Deepwoods campfire and the Clearing hearth and drifts with the wind; interior hearths curl under the ceiling; the Steam Golem vents from its shoulders until it dies, and the Root-vault boiler surges (`js/firesmoke.js`). Stand-in art.
- [~] Wading throws droplets ahead of you; stepping in, falling in and enemies wading or dying in water all splash. Stand-in.
- [~] Outdoor signs swing with the wind and its gusts (barely in a calm, about five times as far in a gale); six cloth banners and pennants hang at the Greenhall, the watch-house and the gate (`js/windbells.js`). Stand-in cloth.
- [~] Falling leaves differ by area (oak in Oakhaven and the Clearing, rust and willow strips in the Deepwoods, ghost-leaves and motes in the Whisper-Grove), are carried by the wind and settle briefly. No blossom: the story is set in autumn.
- [~] The Belfry bell swings on each of its three tolls and keeps swinging as it decays; the Catacombs alarm bell and the arena's Challenger's Bell swing when they ring. The Chapel bell is deliberately not shown: its frame's chalk says the bells were taken in 412 SR and nothing in the story restores one.
- [~] Before the Greening the Kestrel hangs from Oakhaven's mooring mast on its line, drifting and turning with the wind. Stand-in views of the existing sprite.
- [~] Dropped Light-glass shards glint at a distance; No flashes and reduced motion leave a steady glow.
- [~] Eight gates and grates rise as iron lattices; you can pass exactly when the bars clear your head (the existing open > 0.7 threshold, proved against collision at 101 points), and portal gates (the North Gate and others) open before the journey, with a timeout so they can never softlock (`js/gates.js`). Stand-in lattice.
- [~] Once the bore is broken, the Quarry shaft room caves in: groaning and falling dust, then rubble. Anyone caught inside is moved to safe ground, every exit, item and quest target stays reachable (proved by a flood fill), and the rubble is restored from one saved flag after loading. Stand-in rubble.

### Gameplay
- [x] Skill-based three-pin lockpicking for tier-2/3 strongboxes and the Cloister vestry mechanical lock. Keyboard arrows/Space/Enter/Escape, touch buttons and controller D-pad/A/B supported. Story seals remain gated. Successful unlocks advance Lockpicking; higher ranks widen the safe band, slips cost Fatigue/noise and three slips end the attempt. No consumable pick/breakage system in this milestone.
- [x] Oakhaven adult pickpocketing: inspect eligible townsfolk/merchants at arm’s reach with P, touch Purse or controller Y. NPC-relative front/side/rear position, owner attention, noise and Stealth determine displayed lift odds. Caught attempts or third-party witnesses add a 20-sovereign bounty. One saved attempt per purse; loose coin only, no quest items or shop stock. Broader regional placement remains future expansion.
- [x] Drag/drop settled physical bodies at half walking speed without sprinting; conceal/recover them in nonblocking shrouded recesses in Oakhaven, the Quarry and the Cloister. G/touch Body/controller left-stick opens actions. Collision, closed doors and water constrain movement. Visible remains trigger one local 12-second patrol search, without overriding combat or revealing an unseen player; a constable witnessing dragging adds one 20-sovereign bounty per body. Remains/concealment/alarms are current-visit-only; enemy deaths and independent loot retain existing save behavior.
- [x] Synod Clerk Robes sold by Hob, worn through the body armour slot with grey-robed paper-doll art. Ordinary non-boss Proctors/Legionnaires accept distant cover; visible inspection within 2.4 units exposes you in three seconds, twice as fast at noise 4+. Retreat/occlusion reduces suspicion. Witnessed attacks, loud/offensive Songs, throws, dragging bodies and putting on robes break cover. Area exposure survives saves and clothes changes. Combat, body searches, monsters/bosses, story locks and bounty arrests are unaffected. Y/touch Cover/controller Back status and wear/remove actions; written inspection feedback.
- [x] Directional on-screen sound ripples, paired with positional sound. *(Options → Sound ripples; js/ripples.js.)*
- [x] Throwable stones and empty bottles: collision-clipped forward impacts attract idle Oakhaven constables and ordinary non-boss enemies for 6/9 seconds. Walls reduce hearing; visible wanted players, player detection, weapon/Song hits and active combat take priority. O/touch Throw/controller right-stick opens a no-cost choice; 1/A stone, 2/X bottle. Saved inventory, old-save supply pickups, transient targets cleared on load/departure. Vox-Bottles retain their story behavior.
- [x] Three visible, inspectable Catacombs mechanisms: barbed tripwire (one-shot 5 damage), suspended net (eight-second movement slow) and alarm bell (nearby enemy alert). Disarm via existing skill-based three-pin controls; cancellation/three slips leave it armed. Spent/disarmed state persists. Dedicated trap artwork/trigger animations and wider dungeon placement remain later polish.
- [x] Optional Cloister three-voice reliquary and Catacombs physical puzzles: repeat Root → Fifth → Third on the Cloister reliquary; weight or step onto the drowned-chapel pressure plate to unlatch the west counter-weight niche; rotate the three niche-gallery brass mirrors (`/` and `\`) to guide the green-gold lantern beam into the eastern prismatic lens. Keyboard/touch/controller support, written beam/note clues, no resource cost and one-time shard/Lore rewards saved in flags.
- [x] Oakhaven crime system: explicitly owned market and interior goods prompt before theft; visible nearby unstunned NPC witnesses report a 20-sovereign bounty. Nonlethal civilian attacks are reported for 40 sovereigns with cooldown protection, preserving quest dialogues and shops. Constables pursue visible offenders and investigate last-seen positions.
- [x] Player wanted posters: two interactive noticeboards in Oakhaven display the current player warrant at 40+ bounty, showing recorded offences and withdrawing upon fine payment or completed custody.
- [x] Watch-house gaol and custody: guard intervention offers checked gold payment, refusal with escape grace, or entry into a playable six-hour custody sentence. Confiscated non-quest gear and ammunition enter validated saved escrow; quest possessions and innate weapons remain safe. Serve the remaining sentence on the bunk or pay the fine for full release and automatic evidence return. Alternatively, pick the cell door to explore the watch-house, pick the evidence chest to recover belongings, and exit via the street door to escape (+60 bounty once, fine remaining outstanding). Escrow merges unrecovered property across re-arrests.
- [x] Personality bribes and Strength threats at the watch confrontation: the arrest panel offers a bribe at 60% of the outstanding fine (minimum 5 sovereigns) checked against Personality, or a threat checked against Strength that keeps the warrant but buys 12 seconds of grace. Odds fall as the bounty grows and stay between 10% and 90%. An accepted bribe withdraws the warrant and notices and returns held evidence; a refusal costs nothing and adds 15 bounty. A successful threat stands the constable down; a refusal adds 20 bounty. Keyboard 3/4/5, touch buttons and controller Y/Back. Scoped to the law dialogue, not a general NPC persuasion system; bribes cannot clear a sentence already being served.
- [x] Horse rental and world-map travel modifiers: the North Gate stables hire the roan mare for 25 sovereigns per in-game day, tracked as absolute world hours (24-hour term, 10-sovereign refund on early return). While hired, world-map journeys take 65% of the road time and reckless travel costs 8% fatigue instead of 20%; the map and journey panel name the horse and its remaining hours. The term lapses silently on the world clock and can be renewed. Keyboard 1/2/Escape, touch buttons and controller A/X/B. Not a steered mount: the horse waits outside interiors, cannot be taken into dungeons and plays no part in combat.
- [x] Optional hunger/sleep needs over long journeys: switched on from the Options panel (off by default, and old saves start fed, rested and off), the road and every other passing hour drains hunger at 2 points per hour on foot or 1 mounted, and sleep at 1.4. Hunger or sleep below 20 warns in writing and halves fatigue recovery from rest and idling; either at zero caps maximum fatigue at half and halves what rest gives back. Honey and other food items restore hunger, rest restores sleep, and the character sheet and journey panel print both values with a word for each. No hidden combat penalties: needs act only through fatigue, healing and warnings.
- [x] Opt-in hardcore single-save/permadeath, isolated from normal saves and imports: confirming in the Options panel makes the current run hardcore for good — one in-page save that is written again in place, and no session slots, save codes, downloads or pre-boss autosaves. Death destroys that save, hides the lamp, and offers only an end-of-run return to the title. `restoreGame` refuses both directions of mixing, `encodeSave`/`decodeSave` refuse hardcore payloads, and a hardcore run leaves ordinary saves untouched.

### Story and world-building
- [x] "Any news?" at the Boar & Dulcimer: 81 rumours from Hetty and the patrons, each heard only when its deed or story stage has actually happened (quests, crimes, bodies, disguises, the Hedge, the weather, the wider world), chosen deterministically and never repeated twice running (`js/rumours.js`).
- [x] The Synod Gazette on the Greenhall, Chapel and Boar boards: eight issues in the Office's flat voice that spin each turn of the story (the Greening is "an agricultural irregularity"), a "Local matters" item for the player's own crimes, and a smuggled Broadsheet Row page from Cosimo Pell once the crates are heard of.
- [x] Sixteen letters from people the player helped, in their own voices and specific to how each quest went, delivered at the next rest, day turn or arrival, some with a small gift, and kept in the logbook (`js/couriers.js`). Oakhaven letters stop when the Rite begins.
- [x] Fourteen dreams of the Octave, the Foundry, the Hedge, the Silencing, the Organum and the Hush (never described, only inferred), at most one per day on resting, deepening with the story, skippable and kept in the logbook (`js/dreams.js`).
- [x] Eighteen echoes heard once each in Light-glass shards, glass-veined rock, glass lamps and Legionnaire cores, tied to their places. Kaelen's own glass has no touch interaction in the game, so it has no echo.
- [x] Twelve pages of Cantor Tobin Ashgrove's journal, spring 412 to autumn 417, found where he walked, read as held documents, tracked in the logbook as Tobin's Journal (n/12), with a keepsake and a closing page for all twelve (`js/tobin.js`).
- [x] Kaelen and Lyra epilogue paragraphs on both endings that vary with the player's choices (the Hedge answer, the boots, Pim, Tobin's blade, the folder, the coda, who travelled with whom), added above the closing line without altering the existing ending text (`js/epilogue.js`).
- [x] Nine in-world documents on duplicate library shelves (an Office memo and a visitors' notice about the Organum, a Fortis soldier's letter home, a Null-Watch line-talk transcript...), "Heard beyond the Reach" codex stubs and margin notes on the continent map. No new regions are playable.

### Audio
- [x] Distinct area/dungeon compositions for Oakhaven, Whisper-Grove and Deep Woods. *(Composed and recorded for Score: Extended — seven area pieces in music/extended/; the original ten cues stay the default.)*
- [x] Individual boss themes (not just shared boss-mode cues). *(Nine recorded boss themes, Extended score.)*
- [x] Authored greetings/grunts per NPC/enemy; voice asset/license tracking (optional TTS already exists). *(Voiced lines for every speaking character and boss: their greetings, mimicry and companion lines from the game's text, plus PROPOSED barks for speaking enemies, generated with Kokoro-82M TTS (Apache-2.0) and treated per character; formant grunts for the rest; licences in ASSETS.md. Human actors could replace any file.)*
- [x] Directional audio with wall muffling and distance falloff.
- [x] Willow wind, rooftop rain and thunder layers.
- [x] Story-evolving main theme across Book One. *(One theme in six recorded stages, tuned flat early and healing by the coda, Extended score.)*

### Technical and polish
- [x] Audit/expand credits for all art, fonts, audio, tools and contributors. *(CREDITS.md, ASSETS.md, in-game credits.)*
- [x] Photo mode: hide interface, pause safely and export a screenshot.
- [x] Optional speedrun timer with pause/loading policy.
- [x] Statistics page: kills, distance, playtime and Songs cast.
- [x] Larger text, reduced shake, no flashes and high contrast across every new effect.
- [x] Translation message catalog, locale selection, fallback and text expansion tests. *(Menus and the whole story in French: 4,255 strings, translated at display time by js/story-i18n.js from locales/story/fr.json; recorded voices stay English.)*
- [~] Windows/macOS/Linux desktop packages, licenses, signing/update decisions and platform input verification. *(Shell, config, CI and decisions in docs/desktop.md; certificates and a signed release need the owner.)*
- [x] Versioned quest/enemy/map mod schemas with validation; no arbitrary script execution from imported content.
- [x] Built-in dungeon editor using those schemas, preview/playtest and safe export/import.

### Owner's list, October 2026 (100 ideas)
Added from the owner's list. Statuses come from a check against the code: `[x]` already in the game, `[~]` partly there, `[ ]` new. Where an item is already in, the note says where.

**Remaining owner's-list phases (plan, October 2026)**
| Phase | Theme | Items |
|---|---|---|
| 12 — Tools of the trade | gear and Songs | Shield bash; two-handed and dual-wielding; throwing nets; fire flasks; silence bombs; Office grappling hook; environmental kills; instruments that change Songs; tuning forks; dowsing for Anchor-roots |
| 13 — The Hush comes closer | horror | Whispers from behind; lights dying; night terrors; haunted house in Oakhaven; the Unrung Bell at night; jump-scare toggle; hounds sniffing your trail; Hushwardens' muffling wave; crows at bodies |
| 14 — A world that shows the story | visuals and animation | The Greening in Oakhaven; spreading Light-glass; root veins; "Octave lights"; mirrors; sealed doorways; breakable barrels; Sunken Court light; NPC weather reactions; swaying capes; tavern sitting/eating; Kestrel flight scene |
| 15 — The province moves | world events and Daggerfall systems | Synod sermons; eclipses; roadside events; burning and rebuilding, permanent deaths; Synod territory; paid training; letters of credit; cheat codes; "Where is" map marks; camp cooking; tavern card game; boss trophies |
| 16 — New ground | new areas | Chlorophyll Flume; underwater dungeon beneath Whisper-Grove; heists (Synod cathedral, Consortium quarry); the Kestrel as a home base with crew |
| 17 — Beyond Book One | extras | Book Two prologue; Port Cantabile trip and the Long Night (both after Book One in canon: presented as marked extras) |
| 18 — Technical | engine and online | Sharper renderer; installable offline app; daily challenge dungeon; ghost replays; messages and leaderboards (need a small server: owner's decision) |
| 19 — Together | two-player co-op | Play Book One with a second player in the same world: one hosts on a computer, the other joins from a phone with a short code; peer-to-peer (no game server of our own) |
| 20 — The painted world | art and landmarks | Hand-painted art for every procedural stand-in (enemy angles, NPCs, panoramas, props); the horizon country finished and walkable; the Chapel seen beyond the Hedge; a visible Chapel bell. Phase 20b: painted ground, walls, tree variety and painted pieces |
| 22 — The Sheep-Walk | a new region | Wethercombe and the Bellwether, sheep and mutton, the Chalk Ram, the fold-fires; the Hanger wood, the Woolwight night hunt, Ewe Barrow and the Old Fleece; lusher flora with fantasy species; camp and fish anywhere |
| 25 — The pixel-3D set | every creature, person and prop as pixelated 3D, from four sides | The bestiary's hand-built views snapped to four sides; the Proctor, the companions and every named person rigged the same way (painted sides and backs); Orla, the Cutter, the Hollow and the props extruded from their paintings; the trees, swarms, fire and the first-person hands stay painted |
| 24 — The opening | a cinematic before the first step | The six intro paragraphs as captions under a flight through the game's own maps: Wethercombe at sunset, the Hedge, the hounds, the Synod column under glass-fire, Oakhaven at dusk, the title, the North Gate |

Festivals: kept, as a second layer under the Eight Feasts. Festivals follow the crop, not the calendar, so they fit Harvestmonth without moving any Vol VII date (Project doc "World Bible Vol VII Addendum - Festivals of the Reach"). Approved by the author (October 2026); built in Phase 12 as its own team: the Last Sheaf (harvest home, forbidden by the Rite and held in secret), the Rite dressed as a false festival, the Eel-Run on the Flume, the Drowned Lanterns in Whisper-Grove.

**Phase 25 — The pixel-3D set** (delivered; owner's request, October 2026: "everything, every asset, character, monster etc to be pixelated 3D", "everything that makes sense to be 3D", then "keep the same pixelated graphics as before, just make it 3D")
- `[x]` The pipeline (P25, `tools/art/pixel3d/voxelise.py`): each painted sprite extruded into a voxel model (every pixel a column whose depth follows the silhouette; the front faces the painting pixel for pixel, the back its mirror a shade darker), rendered by Blender's `bpy` module at the painting's own density from four sides (front, left, back, right; the owner's call, since the 45-degree views of an extrusion look square) in five poses under one sun with gentle shade bands, packed into one atlas per model with the cell table in `js/pixel3d.js`. One switch, Pixel-3D models; off is byte-identical to the painted art (`test/pixel3d.test.js`).
- `[x]` The bestiary: its Phase 20 hand-built views (js/bestiary20a.js, js/bestiary20b.js), which beat any extrusion from the side, snapped to the four sides. The swarms, the moth, A Quiet, the cat and the fire are symmetric or shapeless and stay painted.
- `[x]` Painted side views for the main species (owner's request): the Catalogue Proctor, Kaelen, Lyra, the townsman and the townswoman rigged with js/bestiary20b.js's humanoid kit in js/people25.js (the body as sections of the painted silhouette, the staff, arms, jug and boots cut out and re-hung, the back painted from their own cloth), in idle, walk and strike where they have the frames; then the second batch, Hetty, Rooke, Sable, Hob and Nell; then the rest of the named cast in batches (Flambeau, Vane, Pim, Vosk, Harrow; Tobiah, Aldric, Bettany, Tam; Quist, Halder, Sexton, Herald; Mags, the Mourner, Wren, Burlsick): 27 rigs. Orla, enthroned among her roots, and the Cutter, a wreck, are not people shapes and stay extruded.
- `[x]` The extrusion is left to Orla, the Cutter, the Hollow and the props.
- `[x]` Props: the scenery props (chests, beds, looms, tombs, lamps, bells, signs, ladders, the Phase 20b barrel and crate), one view each, their depth set per piece (round things fully, flat ones a little).
- Kept painted on purpose: the trees (the painted variants of Phase 20b), the first-person hands and weapons (they never turn), the skies, decals and ground.
- A first pass with low-poly models scripted from primitives was built and rejected by the owner ("the new graphics look terrible"): the painting had to stay the painting.

**Phase 24 — The opening** (delivered; owner's request, October 2026: "an Elder Scrolls Oblivion level of awesome cinematic scene" before the game starts)
- `[x]` The sequence (P24, `js/cinematic24.js`): a catechism over black, then seven shots through the real maps in the player's own renderer and preset, the INTRO lines as captions, letterbox bars, a title card, and an end on the North Gate that is the first frame of play. Nothing in the world is changed by it.
- `[x]` Voices and score (P24): a narrator (an older man; Kokoro `bm_daniel`, chosen by the owner from four auditions) reads the INTRO lines; Ignatius Crane and the congregation speak the Catechism of the Pure Note, Ignatius's "One note. One law. One hand." comes over the column, and Old Harrow speaks two [PROPOSED] lines at the gate. An original score, `music/opening.mp3` (`tools/music/pieces/opening.py`), is written to the shots and ducked under each line.
- `[x]` Skipping (P24): Esc, Enter, Space, a click or the Skip button, through the old intro's own handlers.
- `[x]` The setting (P24): Options -> Graphics & access, "Opening cinematic" On/Off (off gives the old scrolling text back unchanged) and "Watch the opening again" from inside a game.
- `[x]` Access (P24): Reduce motion holds every shot still and cross-fades; No flashes keeps the glass-fire steady; the CPU raycaster runs the same shots at eye height.
- Owner's decisions: should a later phase open on the Prologue itself (Solenne on the risers, 412 SR) before this flight? Harrow's two gate lines: keep, cut or reword?

**Phase 22 — The Sheep-Walk** (delivered as Phase 22a and 22b; owner's request, October 2026: a whole new region "packed with fun things to do", sheep and mutton on every menu, deadly dungeons, new loot, weapons, armour and quests, a night hunter dressed as sheep, lusher flora with fantasy species, camp and fish anywhere. All new text is [PROPOSED]: see story/Game Layer/Phase 22 - New In-Game Text.md)
- `[x]` Wethercombe (P22a): a chalk combe south of the Watch Downs, reached by a new stile. The Bellwether inn, the Farrants' farm and fold, orchards, the snapped Consortium pylon on Pylon Hill. Sheep that wander, graze and bleat.
- `[x]` Quests (P22a): Strays (five ewes home to the fold), The Scouring (the Chalk Ram, six stakes), Three Fires (the fold-fires), The Iron Hum (the pylon's singing wire and its hounds).
- `[x]` Mutton (P22a): salt mutton, broth, chops, pie, hotpot and a roast leg at Hetty's, Brenna Loft's, the provisioner, Vane, Sloe's chandlery, the Bellwether and the Farrants.
- `[x]` Flora (P22a): beech, ash, yew, hawthorn, elder; banks, hedges, walls, meadows and woods thick with undergrowth; fantasy species: bell-ash (chimes in the wind), glass-thorn and lantern-bell (glow at night), whistle-grass, echo-poppy.
- `[x]` The Hanger (P22b): a thick beech wood behind Wethercombe (some 600 trees: close thickets, open glades, and rides lined with trunks), the Woolwight's nest, the wool-tree, a charcoal-burners' ring.
- `[x]` The Woolwight (P22b): a night hunter in stolen fleeces that bleats in the woods. It comes only at night on the region's open maps, spawns out of sight, keeps out of firelight, answers with decoy bleats and leaves at dawn. Lambkins; the Old Fleece (boss).
- `[x]` Ewe Barrow (P22b): a trapped long barrow under the sarsen, opened when the Ram is white and the fires burn. Grave goods (torc, amber, lunula), new weapons (shepherd's crook, barrow shears, leaf-blade) and armour (barrow helm, the Old Fleece's shroud, drover's boots).
- `[x]` Quests (P22b): Bleating in the Wood and The Lambing at Night.
- `[x]` Camp and fish anywhere (P22b): a camp kit pitches a fire and bedroll on any open outdoor map (not in town): sleep, roast, cook, strike. A line fishes any water within a cast: trout, perch, a glass eel at night, the odd boot.
- Owner's decisions: see the "Questions for sleeves" in the Phase 22 text document.

**Phase 20 — The painted world** (delivered in two passes; owner's request, October 2026: work on the hand-painted art when the chance is opportune, and finish the horizon and landmarks. The first pass was four teams (HORIZON, BEASTA, BEASTB, FOLK: js/horizon20.js, js/bestiary20a.js, js/bestiary20b.js, js/sky.js, js/ceilings.js, js/icons.js); the second, Phase 20b "The painted world, finished", is js/painted20.js. Review text: story/Game Layer/Phase 20 - New In-Game Text.md and Phase 20b - New In-Game Text.md)
- `[x]` Hand-built five-angle views for all 25 other species (P20 BEASTA/BEASTB), the panoramas and the Kestrel flyover in pixel art (P20, js/sky.js), the ceilings (P20, js/ceilings.js), painted item icons (P20 FOLK).
- `[x]` Painted ground (P20b): four grass tiles and two mosses painted at load from each map's own tile, laid cell by cell (clover in the hollows, straw on the flats, trodden earth by roads and doors) on every grass and moss map.
- `[x]` Painted walls (P20b): three more house fronts and two more stone courses; one face per building or run of wall.
- `[x]` Tree variety (P20b): the oak in three colours, the willow in two, half of them turned about, by where they stand.
- `[x]` Painted pieces (P20b): paintings for the barrel, crate, hand-cart, broken cart, broken statue, bones, two grass tufts, a reed, a wall notice, a Synod notice and a moss patch (img/painted20/, from Canva's image generator, keyed by tools/art/painted20/key.py). The open and side barrels followed (October 2026). The mosses, cracks and scorch marks followed, rendered by Blender (tools/art/decals/marks.py). The second statue and the stone head were painted in October 2026. Still drawn stand-ins: the third tuft, the second reed, the other two posters and the second Synod notice; NPCs keep their one painted view (they face you, as in Daggerfall).
- `[x]` The horizon country (P20 HORIZON, P22, P20b): the Watch Downs and Wethercombe are walkable country beyond the walls; Oakhaven is drawn past the Hedge from the clearing and the Downs; the far ground beyond a map's edge now runs on every outdoor height-mapped map (P20b). The Chapel bell stays undrawn: the story keeps the frame empty until it rings (the belfry and the empty frame are drawn, P20).
- Owner's decisions: brick nogging on one Oakhaven house in three, keep or cut? Go on with Canva's image generator for the remaining drawn stand-ins, or keep those drawn? (Phase 20b text document.)

**Phase 19 — Together** (delivered; see the Phase 19 verification; owner's request, October 2026: "me and my brother", the brother most likely on a phone)
- `[x]` Join with a code (P19): the host opens "Play together" and gets a short code; the guest types it (or scans a QR code) on a phone. Peer-to-peer over WebRTC, matched by the free PeerJS broker; a copy-and-paste fallback that needs no broker at all. No game server of our own, no accounts.
- `[x]` Host-authoritative world (P19): the host's game runs the world (enemies, the random streams, quests, the story); the guest sends inputs and receives compact snapshots, with smoothing and a little prediction so a phone on Wi-Fi feels responsive. Reconnect after a dropped connection; the host can always carry on alone.
- `[x]` The second traveller (P19): the guest brings their own character (class, level, kit) from their own save; they appear in the host's world as a full player, not a companion. Revive a fallen partner instead of dying; enemies pick between the two; shared XP; loot split by turns; the host's story and choices stay the host's (the guest watches story scenes and can't make the host's choices).
- `[x]` What goes home (P19): the guest's level, XP and items earned go back to the guest's own save; the host's save holds the world. Nothing in either save is ever overwritten by the other player.
- `[x]` Phones as they are (P19): no separate phone mode (owner's call: the graphics are light enough). The guest uses the game's existing touch controls and presets; the phase only checks that joining and playing work in a phone browser.
- Owner's decisions: can the guest also host from a phone (performance)? Should the guest be able to make story choices on their turn? (Defaults: host on a computer; host decides.)

**Phase 10 — the owner's picks** (delivered; see the Phase 10 verification below)
| Item | Status | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Blob shadows under enemies, NPCs and companions | `[x]` | js/look10.js: depth-correct ground shadows; Options → Ground shadows (off in Original and Low). |
| Colour grading per area (amber Oakhaven, teal Whisper-Grove, violet Deep Woods) | `[x]` | Retuned in js/post.js, per-hour shifts kept, whites protected. |
| Lasting marks where fights happened (blood, scorch, cracks) | `[x]` | js/look10.js: for the current visit, capped at 40; constructs spark, Hollows leave nothing. |

**Technical**
- `[x]` A sharper renderer with the pixel look kept (P14: Ultra and Cinematic presets, view distance to 4x; P18: a WebGL2 compositor in front of the CPU raycaster: integer upscale, HUD text at device resolution, grade/bloom/the Cinematic loop in shaders, canvas fallback; real-GPU timings still to be measured) · `[x]` Installable offline app from GitHub Pages (P18; the owner turns Pages on: Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions) · `[x]` Daily challenge dungeon (P18) · `[x]` Ghost replays of boss runs (P18)

### Phase 19 "Together" verification
- **How it was built.** Three parallel teams (net, sync, partner), each against the others' published contracts, then a finishing team that wired them end to end and polished the figures; integration on phase19-together. Owner's decisions: no separate phone mode; the host plays on a computer and makes the story's choices; the relay on for mobile data.
- **Net (js/net19.js, js/vendor/peerjs.min.js 1.5.5 pinned).** "Play together" on the title screen and in Options: Host gives a six-character code, a QR code and a link; Join by code, by scanning, or by link. PeerJS's free matchmaker with Google STUN and PeerJS's public TURN relays (direct first; the relay only when direct fails); a no-matchmaker fallback of codes swapped by hand. Every frame is validated (size, shape, depth, sender, rate); names are text only; two players at most; reconnect within 90 s while the host plays on.
- **Sync (js/sync19.js).** The host's game is the world: the guest sends inputs at 30 Hz with prediction and reconciliation; the host sends delta snapshots of what the guest can see at 15 Hz (12.8 KB/s average in a 30-enemy fight), including enemy strike, wind-up and hurt poses; the guest follows the host between maps.
- **Partner (js/partner19.js).** The guest's own traveller in the host's world, drawn as a pixel-art figure in their likeness and lit like the townsfolk; enemies choose between the two; no friendly fire; downed and revived (both down is the host's death screen); full XP to both, loot by turns, enemies scaled for two; story scenes shown to the guest read-only. What the guest earns is written back only to the guest's own save, checked; the host's save never contains the guest.
- **The guest's side.** The guest's HUD shows their own traveller; resting, items, loading and the hardcore switch defer to the host's world; "Part ways and go home".
- **Tests.** New suites net19, sync19, partner19 and an end-to-end together19 (host desktop, guest Pixel 7 landscape, real NET19 + PeerJS + WebRTC through a local signalling stub, nothing leaves the machine; single-player identical with all three modules loaded); the full run's results are in the Phase 19 PR.

### Phase 18 "Technical" verification
- **How it was built.** Four parallel teams (gpu, pwa, daily, ghost), a rework of the ghost figure, then integration on phase18-tech (which also carries Phase 17 and the Phase 16 canon rulings).
- **GPU (js/gpu18.js).** A WebGL2 compositor wraps render(): the CPU raycaster's frame, material and depth buffers are uploaded as textures and presented with an integer nearest-neighbour upscale; the HUD and everything drawn over the view go to a device-resolution canvas, so Medium's panel text is crisp; post.js's grade and bloom and cinema14's full-resolution loop run in shaders (bit-identical to the CPU path in seven reference scenes). Auto-on only with hardware WebGL2; Options switch; canvas fallback on any error or lost context; Original never uses it.
- **PWA (js/pwa18.js, sw.js, manifest.webmanifest, tools/pwa/, .github/workflows/pages.yml).** Installable; offline after the first visit (195 core files precached, music and voices cached on first play or by an Options button); an update notice that never interrupts a fight or a hardcore run; optional "Keep saves on this device" (off by default; never hardcore saves or extras); a GitHub Actions workflow publishes the game to GitHub Pages. `node tools/pwa/precache.js` regenerates the file list and the test fails if it is stale.
- **Daily (js/daily18.js).** A three-floor dungeon generated from the UTC date (same everywhere), early-game enemies only, a fixed kit, a score, a local table and a share code checked against that day's dungeon; its own title button; isolated like the extras (EXTRAS17's `hidden` option); races your best daily ghost.
- **Ghost (js/ghost18.js).** Every boss fight is recorded; your best run per boss replays as a translucent figure in your likeness; Watch from the boss trophies; ghost codes to share; gameplay identical with ghosts on or off.
- **Tests.** New suites gpu18, pwa18, daily18, ghost18; the full run's results are in the Phase 18 PR.

### Phase 17 "Beyond Book One" verification
- **How it was built.** Four parallel teams (extras, prologue, cantabile, longnight), the Extras framework merged first so the others built on the real API, then a graphics-polish team over the three extras, then integration on phase17-beyond. Everything is set after Book One and reached only from the Extras menu.
- **Extras (js/extras17.js).** An Extras button on the title screen; a one-time spoiler notice (Book One's ending and the later books); unlocked only when Book One is truly finished (the "Not yet" ending; "Grab the Line" ends Part Two and does not count, author's ruling) or by loading or checking such a save; there is no early unlock. Each extra runs in an isolated session: the Book One game is set aside by reference and given back untouched (tested byte-identical); the extra keeps one save of its own; save codes and downloads are off inside an extra; a banner says "An extra — after Book One". WINTER17: snow on the ground and wall tops, falling snow, cold grade and breath (off in Original and Low).
- **Prologue (js/prologue17.js): "The River Gate".** Rootday the nineteenth of Frostmonth 419 (Book Four, Part One, ch. 4): Lyra up the Greenroot road at dusk, stones set on the graves, the voice outside the Hedge ("Lyra-love") and NOBODY on the slate, Oakhaven as a wood with the houses in the crowns and the leaves down, Dorran Sedge at the river gate. No combat; Lyra has no voice, holds a lantern and her slate. Named "The River Gate", not "Book Two — prologue", because any Oakhaven scene earlier than Book Four would contradict the books.
- **Cantabile (js/cantabile17.js): "A trip to Port Cantabile".** Ashfall 419, before the Burning: the cliff harbour on the Phase 2 height system, the Long Mole and the Mole-bell, the Salt Stair's six landings with lamps lit landing by landing at dusk, the counting-house sealed at the top, the Harbour Office, the chandler, the Cay with its grave bells. Errands: the dues paid at the slack key (read the hour from the reef's pitch), the valve, Marrin Tace's vox-bottle, the salvage crate.
- **Long Night (js/longnight17.js): "The Long Night".** The Longest Night under the orchard: ten hours of a held-pitch lullaby against escalating waves, lamps to trim and refill, three young Cantors to keep out of the dark, sounds going missing as the tune falls; falls instead of death; dawn on 1 Stillmonth wins; a local best-times table. No Organum, no Vaelen.
- **Integration fixes.** snapshotGame() now returns a copy (before, flags, journal, ledger and the player's arrays were live references, so a saved slot changed with later play); the extras17 test accepts the shipped extras; split-markup French fragments; a short sword in hand in Cantabile and the Long Night.
- **Tests.** New suites extras17, prologue17, cantabile17, longnight17; the full run's results are in the Phase 17 PR.

### Phase 16 "New ground" verification
- **How it was built.** Four parallel teams (flume, deep, heist, kestrel), then a graphics-polish team over all four areas, then integration on phase16-ground. Every area is optional side content: nothing blocks or reorders Book One.
- **Flume (js/flume16.js).** Three maps through a new east Hedge door in Oakhaven: the Flume Road (a grown-wood aqueduct carrying green water uphill, its held "ohh" positional at 174 Hz; Flume surges down the Wash that push, slow and tire but never hurt, telegraphed by a rising pitch; briar-sprites that bleed you and steal fatigue; ringing timber that carries noise), Stillwater Landing (the lock quest, three ways to open the wheel; Pellam Dree sells the same news to six parties; a fence) and the Low Rings, Oakhaven's flooded lower quarter. Closed after the Greening (the Hedge takes the door; an open quest closes with a journal line).
- **Deep (js/deep16.js).** The Lower Plazas beneath the Sunken Court after the Greening: swimming under water (rise, sink, swim along your look), a breath meter with warnings, grace and rising damage, six air pockets, three depths, Drowned Hollows standing as guards; weapons slower, only the murmur carries; underwater view (murk, caustics, silt) and muffled sound. A 3D search finds no softlock (longest swim between air 15.5 s). Reward: the relief register, nine Lantern Row names for the Ledger and a new Sable topic.
- **Heist (js/heist16.js).** Two planned break-ins with five approaches each (quiet, bribe, cover, disguise, loud): the Held Letters in the Chapel vestry (six letters to deliver; all six earn Letter-Bearer) and Depot Three at the quarry (the roster and the Reeve's lease; who you give them to moves standing). Caught = bounty and the haul seized through the existing law flow.
- **Kestrel (js/kestrel16.js).** The Drift-Kestrel as a home base: deck and below-decks, boarded from the Whisper-Grove ladder (and from the Deep Woods once the tank is patched); seven upgrades; crew Mags, the engineer (unnamed), Nell, Hob and Pim with small perks.
- **Graphics.** The Flume walls are grown wood with the light in the water; the Low Rings dressed with sunk roofs, posts and wreckage; proper arrival paintings for the new outdoor maps (the woods fallback is gone for them); Cinematic-only fill light below-decks and in the heist rooms (stealth unchanged); the Deep balanced for Medium; long look-at lines wrap inside the view. All new effects are off in Original and Low.
- **Integration fixes.** Authored voices for seven new speakers; the Deep's footstep wrapper passes the Tarrow house's hooks through.
- **Tests.** New suites flume16, deep16, heist16, kestrel16; all 93 suites on the merged tree (several perf and timing checks are load-sensitive and pass on a quiet rerun).

### Phase 15 "The province moves" verification
- **How it was built.** Four parallel teams (synod, roads, ledger, hearth), then integration on phase15-province.
- **Synod (js/synod15.js).** Sermons on Dawnday mornings and Stasisday/Memoryday evenings (attend for Church standing and a day's easier inspection; disrupt = witnessed crime, Hedge up); ending at the Greening. The Synod wash on the world map by story stage. Eclipses on new-moon Dawndays, never on feast, festival or story days, x1.25 hounds.
- **Roads (js/roads15.js).** One roadside event per trip at most (cart, refugees or graves, Synod checkpoint; turning back always allowed, key items never taken). Four unnamed houses can burn, char and be rebuilt over six days; witnessed arson +90 bounty. Permanent deaths for unnamed townsfolk with a floor population.
- **Ledger (js/ledger15.js).** Eight trainers with caps and per-level session limits (Lyra teaches Law-Song only after the Greening, by slate). Letters of credit 25/100/500 (5% in Oakhaven; worse rates after the Greening, never lost). The test console (five codes; marks the save; shut in hardcore). "Where is…?" map pennants.
- **Hearth (js/hearth15.js).** Camp cooking (three dishes, one warmth buff at a time). Rounds, a 24-card trick-taking game with its own seeded deck and a daily loss cap. Twelve boss trophies on pegs in your house, granted retroactively.
- **Integration fixes.** The preacher's voice; hearth15 counts only its own items; motion10 checks the travel animation with roadside events off.
- **Tests.** New suites synod15, roads15, ledger15, hearth15; all 89 suites pass on the merged tree (several perf and timing checks are load-sensitive and pass on a quiet rerun).

### Phase 14 "A world that shows the story" verification
- **How it was built.** Four parallel teams (greening, skies, props, folk) plus two graphics teams (far, cinema), then integration on phase14-world; the aurora and the mirrors each went back for a rework before merging.
- **Greening (js/greening14.js).** Oakhaven greens in stages keyed to story flags, creeping during the escape; Light-glass spreads from the bore at rite/seat/greening; root veins pulse near story-gated Anchor-roots.
- **Skies (js/skies14.js).** The Octave lights (thin translucent ribbons, story nights, sky pixels only); the once-only skippable Kestrel flight (outcome identical); caustic light on the Sunken Court.
- **Props (js/props14.js).** Mirrors with a real reflected room and figure (cached ray pass; the rare dark shape never with scares off); shimmering membranes on six sealed doors (including relief maps, where no membrane drew at all before); breakable barrels and crates with seeded loot, story props excluded, crime if witnessed.
- **Folk (js/folk14.js).** Hoods in rain, huddling at fires in cold, swaying coats and capes, tavern seating, eating, drinking, and Hetty serving.
- **Far (js/far14.js + engine).** View distance slider to 4x (Far / Very far / Horizon) and the Ultra preset; sky-matched aerial haze, texture-averaged far detail, sprite LOD, flat far fills; indoors capped at 1.4x so darkness stays the limit; gameplay traces identical at 1x vs 4x.
- **Cinema (js/cinema14.js).** The owner-approved Cinematic preset: bloom only from lamps and Light-glass, god rays at quarter resolution, noise-modulated ground fog, grade and vignette on the compositor; ~1-2.3 ms a frame added at 2x in the reference scenes; no depth-of-field, no particles.
- **Tests.** New suites greening14, skies14, props14, folk14, far14, cinema14; all 85 suites on the merged tree (the full run's results are in the Phase 14 PR).

### Phase 13 "The Hush comes closer" verification
- **How it was built.** Four parallel teams (nerves, night, house, hunters), then integration; merged to main with #21.
- **Nerves (js/nerves13.js).** Jump scares setting (Off / Gentle / Full) that every other module reads; whispers from behind at Dissonance above 55 (Dread on); dying lights in five corridors.
- **Night (js/night13.js).** Night terrors after unsafe rest (never in towns, inns, camps, near bosses); the Unrung Bell on some nights (always before the Rite), x1.25 hounds that night; stops after the Greening.
- **House (js/house13.js).** The Tarrows' house: Nan Tarrow's unfinished count, settled with the kettle, the fork and a held pitch, and a name. No combat.
- **Hunters (js/hunters13.js).** Scent trails (hounds follow where you walked at half speed; water, fire, damper jars and strong smells break it), the Hushwardens' grey wave, crows at bodies whose scattering can alert foes.
- **Integration fixes.** One shared lookup of the scare setting; the grey wave honours Off; the bell's duck returns the sound bus to its resting level; older tests adjusted for scent trails and timing races.
- **Tests.** New suites nerves13, night13, house13, hunters13; all 79 suites pass on the merged tree (several real-time checks are load-sensitive and pass on rerun).

### Phase 12 "Tools of the trade" verification
- **How it was built.** Five parallel teams (arms, kit, rigging, songcraft, festivals), then integration on phase12-tools.
- **Arms (js/arms12.js).** Shield bash (guard + strike; heavy foes only stagger, bosses ignore it), two-handed grip table and three new two-handers, dual-wielding with an off-hand slot. Integration kept the base game's shield stowing beside a two-hander instead of removing the shield.
- **Kit (js/kit12.js).** Oil flasks (fire patch, 8 s, beasts and people will not cross; loud; a witnessed fire in town is a crime), damper jars (6 s silence; no Songs inside), weighted nets (pin small/ordinary foes; bosses and the Hush immune).
- **Rigging (js/rigging12.js).** The Office grapnel (found at the wrecked cutter; five safe anchors), chandeliers and scaffolds that fall on foes (permanent), shoving small foes into deep water.
- **Songcraft (js/songcraft12.js).** Lute, flute and hurdy-gurdy change Songs; tuning fork; dowsing rod (story-gated). Integration fix: composed Songs (Spellmaker) were paid for but never sung; castSong now calls executeCustomSong (test/customsong.test.js).
- **Festivals (js/festivals12.js).** Canon from the approved Vol VII addendum: the Last Sheaf (prepared, postponed by the Church, held in secret at the dead hour), the Rite as false festival, the Eel-Run, the Drowned Lanterns.
- **Other fixes.** Long place names in the HUD squeeze to fit; the Rite herald has an authored voice.
- **Tests.** New suites arms12, kit12, rigging12, songcraft12, festivals12, customsong; all 75 suites pass on the merged tree (air11, festivals12, logmap and screens have timing checks that failed once under load and passed on rerun).

### Phase 11 "Feedback and feel" verification
- **How it was built.** Five parallel teams (hud, flourish, air, tavern, calendar), then integration on phase11-feel.
- **HUD (js/hud11.js).** Hit-direction marker, enemy health bars, damage numbers, organ-pipe gauges, stillness tint; each its own switch, off by default; read-only (seeded fight traces identical on/off).
- **Flourish (js/flourish11.js).** Hit-stop on strong blows and parries (pauses the simulation, not outcomes), weapon trails, level-up notes, quest banner, loot flight, shop coins, page turns.
- **Air (js/air11.js).** Sun shafts (Deep Woods, Cloister), heat haze, Light-glass glare, see-through ghosts, cold breath, footprints; each under ~1 ms a frame and off in Low and Original.
- **Tavern (js/tavern11.js).** Bones with Garrow Finch (own RNG stream, 1–20 stakes, 60 a day loss cap), the evening set "The Boar's Reel", the Whisper-Grove cat (adopt by feeding on three days; hisses at hidden foes).
- **Calendar (js/calendar11.js).** Follows World Bible Vol VII: G.day 0 = Nullday the sixth of Harvestmonth, 419 SR; the Rota line per weekday; Canopy as a quiet remembrance; market every Massday; moon phases scale hound spawns (new ×1.25 … full ×0.75); birth signs (+5 to one attribute per mode); "Previously…" card on load; performance overlay (F10).
- **Integration fixes.** gates and frames tests hold the new Air effects and the calendar date out of their "switch off = original" comparisons.
- **Tests.** New suites hud11, flourish11, air11, tavern11, calendar11; all 69 suites pass on the merged tree (couriers and screens have real-time timing checks that fail now and then under load and pass on a rerun).

### Phase 10 completion pass verification
- **How it was built.** Four parallel teams (look, motion, dread, origins), then integration.
- **Integration fixes.** Ground shadows join the Low preset's off list (about 1 ms a frame in town). Blocking and parrying did nothing before (the timers never ran and no blow read them); js/guard.js makes them work: a parry turns a melee blow aside, a block halves it (a third with a shield), bolts and traps are never blocked. Save codes now inflate in chunks with an 8 MB cap. Tests that required data-URL sketches now also accept the logbook paintings.
- **Switches.** Ground shadows, Fight marks, Travel route, Guard lanterns, Parry sparks, Dread, Interaction modes: all in Options; off gives the game as before, and the Original preset leaves the visual ones off.
- **Tests.** New suites look10, motion10, dread, origins, guard; all suites pass on the merged tree except couriers, whose real-time timing checks fail about one run in three under load (this predates Phase 10; it passes on a rerun).

### Phase 9 completion pass verification
- **How it was built.** Four parallel teams from a lore brief drawn from the author's bibles and Book Four (wind-reed dies in a day; the First Reed; Ada Pellow; Reeds-Miner Tomas; the third parish's note; Mire-drones and Fret-crawlers), then integration.
- **Reed-craft.** Reed beds by the Flume crossing and in the clearing; cut reeds dry after a game day; Hold the Pitch is one reusable minigame (keyboard, mouse/touch, gamepad, an assist option, reduce-motion form); root-note and lure reeds, and REEDS.tuneFirstReed for quests.
- **Side quests.** A Reed for Pellow (Joram Pellow's note, from Tam or Kaelen's glass hand), The Ringing Wood (felling iron-bough with the real noise system), Telling the Bees (Bettany). Each closes with one line if the Greening comes first.
- **The Third Parish.** Reached through Harrow's new topics and a world-map waypoint; Greenroot village, the chapel and the undercroft with a flooded crypt, a bell puzzle and a sung-note wall; the story told by absence only; the register goes to Ignatius or to Lyra.
- **Companion talk.** 23 once-only topics for Kaelen, Lyra (slate, then her ruined voice, following the game's flags), Sable, Vane and the Aegis; approval is now kept in the save.
- **Canon fix.** Halder Wick's wife is renamed Bryony so that Ada Pellow, from Book Four, is the only Ada; Halder's affected voice lines were re-recorded.
- **Review.** All new text is in the Project document "Game - Phase 9 New In-Game Text (for review)", with invented facts marked [PROPOSED]. Every new string has French.
- **Tests.** New suites reedcraft, sidequests, parish, companion-talk; all suites pass on the merged tree.

### Phase 8 completion pass verification
- **How it was built.** Four parallel teams (ripples, music, French, painted-art support), then the Commander's art pipeline.
- **Sound ripples.** Options → Sound ripples (off by default) draws arcs at the edge of the view on the side a positioned sound comes from, dashed when it is behind a wall; it follows reduce motion, no flashes, high contrast and photo mode, and changes no gameplay (AI traces identical on and off).
- **Composed score.** 22 recorded pieces in music/extended/ (seven areas, nine bosses, the main theme in six stages that heal from a flat solo cello to choir and bells), written in tools/music/ and rendered with FluidSynth and the FluidR3 GM soundfont. They play only under Score: Extended; the Original ten cues stay the default. A missing file falls back to the procedural piece.
- **French.** The whole story is translated at display time (js/story-i18n.js, locales/story/fr.json, 4,700+ strings, glossary in tools/i18n/glossary.fr.md); English is untouched when English is chosen, and recorded voices stay English.
- **Paintings.** js/painted.js shows a painting from img/painted/ when one exists and decodes, else the procedural picture; the switch is Options → Painted art. Five area cards were painted with Canva AI before its free allowance ran out; the rest are painted locally with DreamShaper 8 LCM (tools/art/paint.py). Pictures the local model got wrong (anachronisms, wrong subjects) were dropped and keep their stand-ins (the SKIP list in paint.py) until a better painting exists.
- **Tests.** New suites ripples, painted, story-i18n; score extended for the recordings; all suites pass on the merged tree.

### Phase 7 completion pass verification
- **How it was built.** Seven parallel teams in their own worktrees, one module and test each: spatial sound, voices and credits, score, play tools, accessibility and translation, mods and the editor, desktop packaging. A small scaffolding commit first exposed the audio context and a routing hook (Audio_.withRoute) so sound modules never patch the browser's audio nodes.
- **Sound.** Sounds with a place in the world pan to their angle, fall off with distance and are muffled through walls; rain beds, willow wind and thunder follow the weather. Voices are a buzz through vowel formants, different per character and family. The procedural score is a stand-in and is opt-in: after listening, the owner preferred the recorded score, so Options > Score defaults to Original and Extended adds the area, boss and story pieces. A soft limiter keeps the mix below clipping.
- **Rules.** Sound modules use their own random stream, so playing a sound can never change a gameplay roll (the creature-life trace check found that). New state lives in G.flags under p7t_ and p7s_ as small integers, validated on read. Mods are JSON only: an allow-list validator rebuilds a clean copy, ids are namespaced, nothing is executed. The desktop shell has context isolation, sandbox, no Node in the page, and a file allow-list.
- **Access.** Reduce motion now also calms swaying grass and creature fidgets; the old subtitles row drives the new captions. Captured mouse and full screen (Alt+Enter) arrived just before this phase.
- **Tests.** New suites `spatial-audio`, `voices`, `score`, `playtools`, `access`, `mods` and the static `desktop` check; all suites pass on the merged tree.

### Phase 6 completion pass verification
- **How it was built.** A lore brief compiled from the author's world bibles and manuscripts (timeline, institutions, Office dialect, the Hush rules, Fortis and Null-Watch voices, tone rules), with the order of authority the game's own text, then the manuscripts, then the bibles. Five parallel teams, one module and test each: rumours and the Gazette, couriers, dreams and echoes, Tobin's pages, epilogues and teasers. Every team wrote all its new prose into a review file; the Commander read it against the game's text before merging.
- **Canon fixes made in review.** The Gazette had called Oakhaven's Rite "the Rite of Pure Unison", which the game's own codex uses for the earlier Sol-Luminary rite; it is now the holding of the Pure Note. An epilogue had Lyra learning to speak again after the coda; she now talks in chalk. Checked and kept: Tobin's blade (415, 174 Hz), the bells taken for bore-teeth, Essa at the sluice, Tobin's last walk south toward the culvert, Lyra's voice following the game's own lyra_voice flag.
- **Rules every module follows.** New state lives only in G.flags under a module prefix (p6r_, p6c_, p6d_, p6t_, p6e_) as booleans or small integers, validated on read; text comes only from constant tables; nothing appears unless the flags prove the deed happened; quest() is never called; each module has a switch that restores the original game.
- **Tests.** New suites `rumours`, `couriers`, `dreams`, `tobin` and `epilogue`; all 43 suites pass on the merged tree.
- **For the author.** Everything beyond the game and the bibles is marked [PROPOSED] in the code (for example the soldier Brannoch, the Rift's Basket 212 log, the courier service itself). The game says "Thursday" in Ada Wick's letter where the bibles name days for the Anchors; Halder's letter echoes it. Options rows for the story switches are not added (they are code switches on UPG).

### Phase 5 completion pass verification
- **How it was built.** A foundation first: the game's three fonts were bundled locally along with a licensed blackletter (the Google Fonts link is gone, so the game renders in its intended type offline, and screenshots no longer fall back to a plain serif), and two security gaps were closed (the character sheet now whitelists the portrait number from a save, as the inventory did, and the logbook strips angle brackets from journal text when it renders, not only when a save loads). Then five parallel teams, one module and test each: frames and fonts, icons and the paper doll, mood portraits, logbook sketches and automap stamps, and loading, death and ending screens. Each branch touched only its own two files.
- **Rules every module follows.** Markup is built only from the module's own constant tables and catalog ids; anything from a save goes in through textContent, and each module has its own hostile-save checks. Nothing new is saved. Each module has one switch (not part of the graphics presets) that restores the original interface exactly, and every panel still fits 640x400.
- **Tests.** New suites `frames`, `icons`, `portraits`, `logmap` and `screens`; all 38 suites pass on the merged tree, and a combined screenshot pass (inventory, logbook, automap, dialogue, an area card, a death screen and an ending) ran with no page errors.
- **Still open:** hand-painted art for every stand-in (frames, icons, the paper doll, expressions, sketches, stamps, loading, death and ending pictures); pickup messages without icons; the Part Two ending's Sable and Pim variants share pictures; human visual review.

### Phase 4 completion pass verification
- **How it was built.** A small foundation first: `Audio_.hum(level, freq, id)`, a sustained voice for continuous sounds (Kaelen's hum needed one; a code survey found the roadmap's "Kaelen hums at low health" had no code behind it), plus six module stubs. Then six parallel teams, one module and test each, in their own worktrees: companions, townsfolk, small life, fire and smoke, wind and bells, gates and cave-ins. Every branch was diff-checked (each touched only its own two files) before merging.
- **Conventions settled during integration.** anim.js sweeps transient entities whenever a map changes, so decorations a module re-creates on each visit (chimneys, torches, banners, critters, tavern stand-ins) are re-added lazily and carry `_decor: true`; the visual and surfaces tests now exempt `_decor` alongside scenery and grass. Townsfolk routines change who is out only when someone's routine changes (or on a load, rest or journey), so they never overrule other code that hides a person.
- **Integration fixes found by testing the merged tree:** the leaves module took over particle drawing and left anim.js's particle list stale after a preset change (it now keeps it in step); an evening stand-in could stand between the camera and the tavern hearth when a test set noon by hand (the post test's scene helper now re-applies routines); working townsfolk no longer also lean in to warm their hands; the doors test raced the live game loop across two pages (its freeze now pins poses and flame glow, and closed doors are compared on one page); and tests that measure one effect now hold other modules' smoke, leaves, crows and banners out of the frame.
- **Measured cost (median ms per frame, `PRESETS.measure()`, same machine, same run):** Phase 3 tip → Phase 4, Medium preset: 7.1 → 7.7 (Oakhaven street, with chimneys, banners and crows), 9.2 → 9.1 (Deep Woods camp), 5.4 → 5.4 (Whisper-Grove), 5.7 → 5.3 (tavern). Original, Low and High move within noise.
- **Tests.** New suites `companions`, `townsfolk`, `smalllife`, `firesmoke`, `windbells` and `gates`; all 33 suites pass on the merged tree. Each module proves its switch-off state matches the original, that nothing it adds is saved, and that save/load and leaving and re-entering a map keep it right.
- **Still open:** hand-painted frames for every stand-in; the Dissonant Blade player's low-health hum; depth-aware leaves (they are screen-space, like the original particles); human visual review and physical-controller hardware.

### Phase 3 completion pass verification
- **How it was built.** Seven parallel teams, each owning one new module and its test file in its own git worktree branched from the phase branch: species life (`creature-life`), hit and boss-phase art (`enemy-fx`), casting tells and entrances (`telegraphs`), first-person hands (`fp-hands`), camera feel (`fp-feel`), doors and props (`doors`) and held documents (`reading`). Every module wraps existing functions instead of editing them, keeps its state in unsaved `_` fields, and has one switch in `GFX` that restores the original behaviour exactly (tests compare frames byte for byte). Each branch was diff-checked before merging and the merged tree re-tested.
- **Integration fixes found by testing the merged tree:** a save taken while a spawned enemy was still arriving recorded it as non-solid (the save now restores solidity); three settings for the same thing were unified (`GFX.reduceMotion`, now following the OS reduced-motion setting, with the old `reducedMotion` name kept as an alias; `GFX.noFlash` now also stops lightning); the deafness and Hush effects gained the sound muffling the feel team could not add from its own files (`Audio_.muffle`, a master low-pass); traversal tests that drop a chasing hound into the map now mark it as already arrived, since such a hound correctly gets a spawn entrance; a feel test that waited on wall-clock frames now waits on the stillness clock; and a pre-existing colour-grade overflow (a teal ring round the dawn sun) was clamped.
- **Measured cost (median ms per frame, `PRESETS.measure()`, headless Chromium, same machine, same run):** Phase 2 tip → Phase 3, Medium preset: 7.0 → 7.0 (Oakhaven street), 9.6 → 9.2 (Deep Woods camp), 5.5 → 5.5 (Whisper-Grove), 5.8 → 5.6 (tavern), i.e. within noise when nothing is happening. Effects cost only while active (feel team, loaded box: Hush 0.4 ms, deafness up to 4.2 ms at full strength).
- **Tests.** New suites `creature-life`, `enemy-fx`, `telegraphs`, `fp-hands`, `fp-feel`, `doors`, `reading` and `grade`; all 27 suites pass on the merged tree, including security, save/load and old-save checks.
- **Still open:** hand-painted frames for every procedural stand-in (flinch, fidget, startle, stride, casting, phase-change, entrance, hands, door and lid art); human visual review and physical-controller hardware.

### Phase 2 completion pass verification
- **How it was built.** An engine foundation first (commit `9394e37`): a 1x/2x render scale with the HUD and input kept in 320x200; per-pixel depth and material on both render paths; sky hooks (before the ridges) and post hooks (before present) that skip themselves on error; `addTexture`/`addSprite`/`setEmissive` for procedural art; per-cell wall decals; close-range detail; per-cell ceilings and absolute ceiling height; per-light visibility masks so lamps stop at walls (and carry over knee-high ones); and a view-distance/interior-darkness `setLook`. `js/gfx.js` holds one switch per effect. Then eight parallel teams, each owning its own module and test file in its own git worktree: sky, post-processing, water, surfaces (decals, detail, ceilings), scenery (props, grass), creatures and light (directions, emissive, dark interiors), traversal (Bell-Tower, quarry, pathing), and presets. Each branch was diff-checked before merging; the combined tree was re-tested, not the teams' reports.
- **Integration fixes found by testing the merged tree:** older tests treated the new transient props and grass as corpses or saved entities (narrowed to real corpses); the surfaces test expected an unchanged quarry ceiling height (traversal raises it on purpose); the creatures test measured glow ratios through the catacombs' new mist (now measured with whole-frame looks off); a hound seen from behind no longer falls back to its front art (the old check now runs with directional views off, and a new one checks the back view). A screenshot review caught bloom lighting a pale cart parked under a street lamp; the engine now marks real light sources as `Engine.MAT.glow` (8) and bloom reads that instead of guessing from colour.
- **Independent audit (a reviewer that wrote none of this code), no blockers.** Saves, transient entities, wrapper chains, scale changes across all 24 maps and reachability came back clean. Fixed from its findings: melee and enemy sight ignored height (a legionnaire on the belfry floor took 33 health from a player on the 1.8 gallery, and the player could strike back); both now need the fighters within 0.7 of each other's level, and sight passes over walls below both eyes (`test/height-combat.test.js`, which fails on the old code); `GFX.plain()` did not reset view distance or particle counts after a preset (it now does, and keeps the render resolution, while `PRESETS.apply('original')` restores everything including 1x); darker interiors had no switch of their own (off in Low, plus a Dark interiors switch in Graphics & access); rain and snow ignored the Particles setting; and light masks were built for every map light each frame (lights beyond the view distance are now culled first).
- **Measured cost (median ms per frame, `PRESETS.measure()`, quiet build server, headless Chromium):** Original 5.9 / 7.7 / 2.6 / 2.3 (Oakhaven street / Deep Woods camp / Whisper-Grove / tavern); Low 5.8 / 7.4 / 3.0 / 4.4; Medium, the default, 6.9 / 10.6 / 6.0 / 4.9; High (2x) 25.0 / 31.5 / 22.0 / 18.9. Medium fits a 60 fps frame here with room to spare; High renders four times the pixels and is opt-in. These are server numbers, not Chromebook numbers: measure on the target machine and choose Low if Medium is slow.
- **Tests.** New suites: `foundation`, `sky`, `post`, `water`, `surfaces`, `scenery`, `creatures`, `traversal`, `presets` and `height-combat`, alongside `relief`, `terrain`, `visual`, `security`, `law`, `travel`, `needs`, `hardcore` and `weather`. All nineteen pass on the merged tree with no browser runtime errors. Every effect proves it is byte-identical to the original look when its switch is off.
- **Still open:** final painted art for every procedural stand-in (directional sheets, panoramas, the flyover sprite, decals, ceilings, props, grass, close-up wall art); walkable horizon country beyond the maps' walls; the Chapel seen from beyond the Hedge; pathing around solid props (trees, crates); a pre-existing quarry room sealed off by a lamp in its corridor mouth (entity positions are frozen for save compatibility); human visual review and physical-controller hardware.

### Relief and slopes pass verification
- **A second render path, chosen per map.** `Engine.setMap` scans each map (`scanRelief`): any height field, sloped corners or cell with its own `top` makes it a relief map, and records its tallest point (`maxTop`). Interiors and other flat maps keep the original renderer untouched (the tavern renders through the old path and its test numbers are unchanged).
- **Front-to-back columns with per-pixel depth.** On relief maps the floor pass no longer draws the ground; each column walks its ray outward and fills rows from the bottom up, so every row is written once by the nearest thing. Ground is drawn as straight pieces along the ray, solved row by row for exact perspective (sloped cells are split in two pieces); a rise between cells is a vertical face; a wall below the eye shows its cap; and the walk continues past tall faces while the tallest thing on the map could still appear above what is drawn. Every pixel records its depth (`Engine.depthAt`); sprites test against it pixel by pixel, with ground surfaces biased 0.45 so a figure's feet never sink into the floor it stands on. This replaces the per-pixel fixed-point floor iteration of the elevation pass, which could not draw slopes reliably at grazing angles.
- **Map data and helpers.** `GameMap` gained `verts`/`smooth` (corner heights and a mask), `groundAt` (bilinear on sloped cells; `lvlAt` now delegates to it), `gradeAt`, `hill(cx, cy, rx, ry, h, { steep })`, `ramp(...)`, `setSide(...)` for riser textures (stone under the Watch-stone, timber under the stand), and `block`/`lowWall` for cells with their own top. New entities from this pass are appended by `addReliefWorld(maps)`, which runs last in the world build, so historical entity indexes and old saves still line up; all other changes are cells and heights.
- **Movement.** Feet snap to a slope while climbing (eased only for stair-sized rises) and follow it down without counting as a fall; `solidAt` refuses ground more than 0.36 above the feet and any uphill step onto a slope steeper than `MAX_GRADE` (1.1). Falling over a too-steep face is a tumble (12 health per unit past 0.9) and says so; a sheer drop keeps the old 26. Enemies obey the same climb limits through `solidAt`.
- **Picking and the crosshair.** The crosshair is drawn at the centre of the view, which is where a pitched look aims; `Engine.pick` accepts the centre or the old eye-level row, so level play picks exactly as before, and on relief maps a pick is refused when the depth buffer shows a wall, roof or crest in front of the sprite at that pixel.
- **Automap.** High ground is drawn lighter in proportion to its height, low walls are drawn pale, tall blocks dark, and slopes too steep to climb are hatched.
- **Measured cost (median of nine 60-frame runs, headless Chromium on the shared build server, ms per frame, old renderer → relief renderer):** tavern 1.35 → 1.31 (flat path, unchanged); Oakhaven street 2.08 → 4.49; Oakhaven by the Chapel 1.94 → 3.88; clearing on the Watch-stone 3.04 → 4.24; clearing meadow 2.78 → 2.89; Deep Woods camp 2.27 → 5.50; Deep Woods willow rise 1.93 → 6.09. Identical runs on this server vary by up to ±1 ms. A CPU profile shows no single hotspot: about a third of the time is ground rows (an exact divide per row instead of an incremental step), the rest spread across the column walk, sprites and lights. Relief maps cost two to three times the flat path here but stay inside a third of a 60 fps frame budget; per the gates above, low-end presets wait for measurements on representative hardware.
- **Tests.** The new `test/relief.test.js` covers relief scanning, the tower showing above the eaves (and being sky without it), seeing over the field wall while it still blocks, a figure behind the wall showing above its cap with zero pixels leaking below, climbing and stepping off the timber stand, the stand's timber footsteps, walking up and down the willow rise without a single fall frame (largest feet-to-ground gap 0.000), the crag refusing a climber, the crag's flat rim, the tumble and its damage and message, the ramp helper's heights and grade, a sprite standing exactly on the hillside, picking that sprite by looking up, the Mausoleum tower in the sky band and the retired silhouette, save/restore on a slope, the automap shading, frame times, and a compact viewport. `test/terrain.test.js` now hides the clearing's enemies during its physics checks: a proctor and mites stand on the Watch-stone, and a stray bite was making its fall-damage check fail intermittently. Syntax, terrain, relief, weather, security, law, travel, needs, hardcore and visual suites pass with no browser runtime errors; the gallery adds five relief captures.
- **Not done, and left in the roadmap:** walkable horizon country beyond the maps' walls, ceilings above raised floors (no interior uses relief yet), traversable rooftops and upper storeys, slope-aware enemy route-finding, the Chapel seen from beyond the Hedge, and resolution/performance presets. Human visual review and physical-controller hardware remain unverified.

### Elevation pass verification
- `GameMap` gained `lvls` (a Float32Array of floor heights, null on every map that has none), plus `lvlAt`, `setLvl` and `raise`. Flat maps take the old render path untouched: Oakhaven and every interior still draw exactly what they drew before.
- The camera gained `z`, the eye height above the world baseline. `settleFeet()` puts the player's feet on the floor of their cell on every map load and restore, and `update` lifts or drops them: steps and ramps ease the eye up, ledge edges fall under gravity, and a landing over 0.9 units costs `(drop - 0.9) * 26` health and says so. A rise taller than 0.36 units is treated as a cliff face by `solidAt`, so the player cannot walk up it; walking down is always allowed and is how falling works.
- The renderer's floor pass is per-pixel on height maps: it projects a ray, reads the cell under it, re-projects with that cell's height and accepts once the height stops moving. The wall pass now collects faces per column - the low step in front and the taller bank behind - and paints them far to near, with a face running from its floor to its absolute top. Sprites take the floor height of their own cell for their baseline, and wall occlusion clips a sprite at the nearest face's top edge instead of hiding the whole column.
- The Watch-stone in the clearing is the authored proof: a mossy 1.2-unit hilltop with four 0.3 steps on its west face, a sign at the top, an open cliff edge on every other side, and trees kept clear of its footprint. Its `floorTextures` list keeps index 2 as water, because `isBlocked` treats that index as impassable.
- Measured cost: 200 renders per position give 1.50 ms at the foot of the hill, 1.70 ms on its top and 1.40 ms in flat Oakhaven, so the height-aware pass costs a fraction of a millisecond in this scene.
- The new `test/terrain.test.js` covers the height data, the stair's four rises, a 1.2 rise refusing a walker while a 0.3 rise does not, walking up to 1.2 feet and 1.7 eye height, walking off the edge to a fall of 8 damage, stairs costing nothing, a sprite standing on the hill rather than the meadow, the cliff disappearing when the height field is removed (27,006 pixels), save/restore on the hill, unchanged flat maps, and the full and compact viewports. The older suites still pass unchanged.
- Also fixed while verifying: `js/weather.js` assigned `wind` without declaring it, so the HUD's weather line could throw before the first weather tick. It is now a declared module variable defaulting to 0.
- Not done, and left in the roadmap: continuous slopes and height-mapped ridges, walkable horizon country (the Grey Teeth are still silhouettes), low walls and rooftops in authored maps, ceilings above raised floors, picking and automap at height, and multi-face occlusion beyond two faces per column. Human visual review of the new ground remains unverified.

### Dynamic weather and horizon country pass verification
- `js/weather.js` owns the sky: six states (clear, overcast, rain, storm, mist, snow) with sight, hearing, haze, darkness, wind, wetness and cloud per state, and a climate table per region so the Spectral Woods sit in mist and the Deep Woods see more snow. The old four-state timer in `js/upgrades.js` now delegates to it, and `UPG.weather`, `UPG.weatherT` and `UPG.weatherFx` are written every tick, so anything that still reads or sets them - including existing perception code, captures and tests - keeps working unchanged.
- Weather is the world's, not the view's: state and remaining hours live in the save (`weather: { s, left }`), older saves open clear, hostile states are refused and hostile durations are clamped to 24 hours. It rolls on the world clock through `Weather.advance` in `passHours`, so resting, travelling and serving a sentence all take hours off the sky, and a real-time trickle of one hour per fifty seconds turns it over during play.
- Gameplay, all hung off the same state: perception ranges scale with sight and hearing (mist hides you at 0.5, a storm covers your noise at 0.45 hearing), world-map journeys take up to 12% longer and are up to 35% riskier in a storm, hunger drains 15% faster in rain or storm while outdoors (indoors it does not), running costs more fatigue in the wet, and the status line and character sheet name the sky, its strength and its remaining minutes.
- The look: `Engine.setWeather` bends air, light, cloud and one bright frame of lightning without touching map data, so the same save renders sunlit or storm-lit; the renderer draws a sun and moon that cross the sky behind the ridges, a cloud layer that thickens and races with the weather, and a weather overlay of slanted rain, ground splashes, drifting mist bands and blowing snow that declines to draw indoors.
- Hills, mountains and cliffs arrive as horizon country: `LANDMARKS` gained named ridges with lumpy crests, snow caps, `far` aerial perspective and per-layer colours for the outdoor maps, drawn before the ridges resolve and mixed by time and weather. They are scenery, not ground - walking on them needs the Phase 2 elevation renderer, and the roadmap now carries that as an explicit milestone.
- Measured cost, not assumed: 200 renders per state in headless Chromium give 1.92 ms clear, 1.91 ms storm and 1.77 ms mist per frame in the same scene, so the whole modern sky pass is inside measurement noise of the pre-existing renderer.
- The new `test/weather.test.js` covers the six states and their meanings, per-region climates and the fallback, every state reaching the renderer and the legacy hooks, the old `fog` name, hand-held skies and their release, clock-driven rolls, save/load, older saves, hostile skies, the status line, the character sheet, journey time and risk, hunger in the wet versus indoors, the overlay being drawn outdoors and not indoors, and a compact-layout check. The needs and travel suites now hold a clear sky, because hunger and road maths are their subject and weather has its own suite; that isolates the system under test rather than weakening any assertion.
- Not done, and left in the roadmap: walkable elevation (hills, mountains, cliff faces with slopes and falling), painted area panoramas and night stars, torch-driven interior darkness, resolution presets and bloom, and weather-aware NPC behaviour beyond detection ranges. Human visual review of the new skies and physical-controller hardware remain unverified.

### Standalone Phase 1 — native game integration
- **Integrated, not just loaded.** `index.html` loads `js/phase1-native.js` after the existing extensions, followed by `phase1_stealth_law_gameplay.js`. The four public Phase 1 APIs select native-backed implementations; without the bridge, the original standalone implementations still work. The combined bundle is regenerated for consistency but is **not** loaded into the game; standalone Phases 2–7 remain unconnected.
- **One authority for state.** The bridge maps the lexical `G`, `G.ents`, `player.inv`, `player.armor`, `player.crime`, `day`/`tod`, and `HARDCORE.save` instead of copying them into the standalone `window.G`, `entities`, `inventory`, `equipment`, `bounty`, `worldHours`, or localStorage save shapes. There is no second update loop, inventory, bounty, custody record or hardcore slot. Existing authored placements and historical entity indexes are preserved; no legacy pickups are injected at unverified coordinates.
- **Disguise and law.** Native sight suppression and robe checks now call the registered Phase 1 API. Hob's existing `a_synodrobe` and timed, line-of-sight inspection remain authoritative, including area-persistent exposure and monster/boss exclusions. Crime APIs use native theft confirmation, witness checks, nonlethal assault cooldowns, registry-backed posters, custody and escrow. Escape still requires playing the cell lock, optionally unlocking the evidence chest, and walking through the street door; it adds the native **60 bounty**, not the standalone 15. Tearing down a notice cannot erase the registry. Watch dialogue obtains Phase 1 quotes and uses existing checked handlers; bribes/threats stay watch-only rather than changing quest NPC dispositions. Threat results come from the actual roll, not a leftover grace timer or capped bounty.
- **Travel, needs and hardcore.** Real world-map journeys call Phase 1's mounted modifiers and advance native `passHours` once, retaining weather/extension hooks. Hiring still costs **25 for 24 world hours**, road time uses the native **0.65 multiplier**, reckless mounted fatigue costs 8% rather than 20%, and cautious recovery is unchanged. Needs remain off by default, with **decreasing** 0–100 food/sleep reserves, existing meals consumed through `useItem`, and rest through the native panel. Hardcore remains explicit opt-in, one full in-page save, no cross-import/export, and permadeath; it does not introduce the standalone persistent localStorage slot or survive closing the page.
- **Packaging.** The service-worker manifest includes both Phase 1 scripts. The desktop resource filter and protocol allowlist include the root-level Phase 1 module without opening other root files.
- **Exercised.** `node test/phase1-integration.test.js` executes the real game/map/travel/weather modules and native UI handlers in a minimal DOM host. It covers registration, enemy sight and inspection, exposure save/load, distraction consumption/investigation, body dragging/concealment, witnessed theft and stale confirmation, assault cooldown, wanted notices, bribe/threat success and failure (including capped bounty with old grace), playable custody save/load, both actual lock puzzles, evidence recovery, escape/re-arrest/release, stable hire, real journey clock/fatigue/needs, needs-off and invalid durations, meals/rest, hostile/old saves, and hardcore overwrite/load/isolation/permadeath. It asserts that no legacy duplicate state is created. Standalone Phase 1, save-security and desktop regression suites also pass.
- **Limits of verification.** These are executable rules/handler checks with a DOM stub, not browser rendering or input-device tests. No new screenshots, human visual/audio review, physical-controller verification, long-form balance pass, production deployment or Git delivery is included. Existing native mechanics and their earlier verification records below are retained, not replaced by the standalone balance or additional dialogue/password/grate systems.

### Hardcore pass verification
- The mode is a saved boolean on the run (`player.hardcore`), off for new travellers and older saves, chosen from the Options panel behind an explicit confirmation. Once on it is one-way for that run: the button is disabled and clicking it only prints why.
- The run's save lives in `HARDCORE.save`, a separate holder from the three ordinary `SLOTS`, so a hardcore run never writes over an ordinary campaign. Saving writes it in place; there is no second copy anywhere.
- Isolation is enforced at the borders rather than in the panels: `restoreGame` refuses a hardcore payload in an ordinary run and an ordinary payload in a hardcore run, `encodeSave` refuses to write a hardcore run as a code, and `decodeSave` refuses a code that contains one. The save panel and load panel simply have no code box, file picker or slot list to offer.
- Permadeath lives in the death path: `die()` clears `HARDCORE.save` before the screen is drawn, hides `#btn-wake`, removes any autosave button and adds the end-of-run action, which returns to the title with the mark cleared. The wake handler also refuses outright while a hardcore run is live, so a stray click cannot drag the traveller back. Pre-boss autosaves are skipped entirely (`tickBossSave` and the `die` wrapper both return early), and choosing hardcore clears any autosave already taken.
- The new `test/hardcore.test.js` covers the off-by-default state, the confirmation and its refusal, the one-way toggle, single-save write and overwrite, code refusal in both directions, cross-loads refused both ways, the load panel listing only the run's save, death destroying the save and hiding the lamp, the end-of-run return to the title, ordinary saves still working afterwards, the ordinary lamp death, the untouched ordinary save panel, and compact-layout checks of the hardcore panels and the Options panel with its tenth button.
- Fixed while verifying the new panel: `css/style.css` styled every `.slot` with the worn-armour grid, so the save and load panels laid their rows out in the wrong columns (the meta text wrapped into a 6 cqw strip). The inventory rule is now scoped to `.slots .slot`, which repairs the ordinary panels too; a capture of the inventory confirms the armour rows are unchanged.
- Syntax, hostile-save security regression, law, travel, needs, hardcore and the full Chromium suites pass with no browser runtime errors, and the thirteen gallery captures regenerate cleanly. Human visual review and physical-controller hardware remain unverified; hardcore is deliberately scoped to saves and death rather than enemy damage, and it does not touch achievements, statistics or leaderboards. The save is in-page, matching a save system built on codes and files where the preview sandbox has no persistent storage, so a hardcore run ends with the tab as well as with the traveller; browser storage persistence is not part of this pass.

### Journey-needs pass verification
- Needs are off by default: `player.needs` is a saved boolean and `hunger`/`sleep` are 0–100 numbers. New travellers and older saves start at 100/100 with needs off, so nothing about the existing game changes until the player turns it on in Options.
- One place spends the clock: `passHours` advances the day, custody and `drainNeeds`, so journeys, resting, custody time and any future time skip all cost the same. Drain is 2 hunger and 1.4 sleep per hour on foot, 1 hunger per hour mounted; `horseActive()` is reused rather than duplicated.
- Needs act only through recovery: hunger or sleep below 20 warns in writing once and halves what idling and rest give back; either at zero caps maximum fatigue at half (`fatCap()`) and halves rest further. No hit chance, armour, dialogue or story gate reads the values.
- Food and sleep feed the system: the existing honey items also restore 35 hunger through `useItem`, and every rest variant tops sleep up and returns some hunger. Values clamp on every write and on import, and print as text through the existing message and panel paths, never as markup.
- The new `test/needs.test.js` covers off-by-default with no drain, the Options toggle both ways, foot and mounted drain, the warning threshold and its written line, the famished fatigue cap, rest and honey, the character sheet and journey panel, save/load persistence, hostile-value clamping, old saves, and a 640x400 overflow check.
- The gallery script (`test/screenshots.js`) now stages eleven scenes, adding the stables, the watch confrontation, a mounted journey on the world map and the two needs panels, and asserts each panel's heading, contents, action visibility and PNG dimensions before writing it. Captures now rasterize text because the sandbox has fontconfig with DejaVu Serif installed, so the earlier empty-panel limitation no longer applies and the previously empty stealth images were recaptured with readable text.
- Syntax, hostile-save security regression, law, travel, needs and the full Chromium suites pass with no browser runtime errors. Human visual review, physical-controller hardware and long-form balance remain unverified; hunger and sleep are deliberately fatigue-only, with no starvation damage, no rebalanced food economy and no NPC sleep schedules.

### Horse-rental pass verification
- The stable marker appends after every earlier Oakhaven entity, so historical save indexes and the map's walkable floor are unchanged; it is non-solid and reachable from the North Gate square. `HORSE` terms live in `js/travel.js`; the service opens through the existing `useDeco` path like other world fixtures.
- The hire term is the saved number `player.horseUntil` in absolute world hours (`day * 24 + tod * 24`). Renting deducts exactly 25 sovereigns and sets `now + 24`; returning clears it and refunds 10. Old saves without the field start on foot. Imported terms are clamped to at most 48 hours past the loaded clock and stored as a bounded number, never rendered as markup.
- Travel maths stays in one place: `travelMinutes` multiplies by 0.65 while hired, and the quoted time is what `travelGo` advances on the clock. Reckless travel on horseback costs 8% of maximum fatigue instead of 20%; cautious travel is unchanged. Risk is untouched except through the shorter time on the road.
- Panel actions re-check the panel token, current map, play state and coin before acting, so a stale hire callback cannot double-charge after leaving the panel. Hiring is disabled without 25 sovereigns; returning is disabled without a live hire.
- Syntax, hostile-save security regression, the dedicated law suite, the new travel suite and the full Chromium suite pass with no browser runtime errors. The travel suite covers placement/reach, the interact path, cost, term, empty purse, road-time ratio, real journey hours and fatigue, refund, lapse and renewal, save/load, hostile-term clamping, old saves, stale callbacks, keyboard 1/2, touch taps, simulated controller A/X/B and a 640x400 overflow check.
- Body-recess fixtures in the law and visual suites now treat the stable as one more append-only town entity instead of assuming exactly three law additions; the assertions themselves are unchanged in strength.
- Human visual review, physical-controller hardware and long-form economy balance remain unverified. The horse is a travel modifier, not a steered mount: no mounted combat, no separate stable per region, and no appetite or injury model.

### Watch bribe and threat pass verification
- Social options reuse the existing arrest panel and saved crime state: no new saved keys, entity indexes, map layouts or save version. `bribeTerms()` and `threatTerms()` derive cost and odds from `crimeState().bounty` plus the saved Personality/Strength attributes.
- Bribe cost is 60% of the fine, floored at 5 sovereigns. Odds are `45 + (attribute - 45) - min(20, bounty * 0.2)`, clamped to 10–90%; threats take a further -5 shift. The panel prints the exact cost and both odds, so the player never gambles on hidden numbers.
- Accepted bribe: deducts exactly the quoted cost, clears the bounty, withdraws wanted notices, returns any escrowed evidence and grants 5 seconds of grace. Refused bribe: no coin leaves the purse, +15 bounty for attempted bribery. Accepted threat: warrant stands, the constable resets to idle and the player gets 12 seconds of grace. Refused threat: +20 bounty for threatening a constable.
- Every action is re-checked against the current panel token, map, custody state, bounty and available coin before it acts, so a stale callback from an older panel cannot spend gold or clear a newer warrant. Bribes are unavailable while serving a sentence, and the existing fine/prison/refusal paths are unchanged.
- Syntax, hostile-save security regression, dedicated law suite and the full Chromium suite pass with no browser runtime errors. The law suite covers cost/odds formulas, both outcomes for each action, the empty-purse state, readable refusal lines, stale callbacks, save/load persistence, and keyboard 3/4/5, touch taps and simulated controller Y/Back, plus a 640x400 overflow check.
- Human visual review, physical-controller hardware and long-form balance remain unverified. Headless screenshots in this environment did not rasterize the Google-hosted display fonts at the time of this pass (superseded later: the capture environment now installs fontconfig with DejaVu Serif, and the gallery was recaptured with readable text), so this pass's layout was checked by DOM geometry rather than by eye. Bribes and threats are deliberately limited to the watch confrontation; general NPC persuasion, bribing a sentence already being served, and faction-wide corruption are not included.

### Broader crime, wanted posters, and prison pass verification
- Jurisdiction and crime reporting: Oakhaven jurisdiction covers town and inhabited interiors (Tavern, Greenhall, Mill, Surgery, Chapel, Tannery, Watch-house). Explicitly owned goods prompt before theft; witnessed theft adds 20 sovereigns. Civilian assault is nonlethal (no damage to shop/quest NPCs, 4-second per-target reporting cooldown, +40 bounty). Stunned NPCs cannot witness; constables always report. Distant regions and story-crisis states retain existing exceptions.
- Guard pursuit and last-seen investigation: constables pursue visible wanted offenders and record their last seen coordinates for 10-second investigation without tracking through solid occlusion.
- Wanted notices: two interactive noticeboards in Oakhaven display warrants when bounty reaches 40+, detailing offences (thefts, assaults, escapes) and withdrawing upon fine settlement or served sentence.
- Playable watch-house custody and evidence: arrest offers checked exact fine payment, refusal with 5-second grace, or custody. Custody teleports to a playable watch-house map with confiscated ordinary weapons, armour, inventory, and ammunition in evidence escrow. Quest items and innate weapons remain on the player. Serving sentence advances world time and releases the player with automatic evidence return; exact payment releases immediately.
- Escape route: the cell door features a mechanical lock (difficulty 2); picking allows walking out into the evidence office. The evidence chest can be picked to recover confiscated items. Stepping through the street door triggers an escape (+60 bounty once, custody cleared, fine outstanding). Re-arrest merges unrecovered property safely.
- Input and layout: keyboard (1/2/3/Enter/Escape), touch buttons, and gamepad controls work for all arrest and prison panels; compact 640×400 layout verified free of overflow.
- Persistence and security: save/load preserves custody remaining time, escrow contents, wanted notices, and lockpick state. Old saves default safely to zero crime. Hostile save codes cannot inject markup through warrants, evidence arrays, or custody objects; custody pointing outside watch-house is rejected.
- Syntax, security test, dedicated law suite, and full visual suite pass with no browser runtime errors. Screenshots: `/tmp/octave-prison-panel.png`, `/tmp/octave-prison-small.png`, `/tmp/octave-wanted-poster.png` (verification artifacts).

### Synod-disguise pass verification
- Clerk robes use existing item/armour/trade/save interfaces (`a_synodrobe`, body slot, AR 1, noise 0, value 32, weight 2). Hob sells them; no entity indexes, map layouts or story gates change. Equipped robes have a grey skirt and silver registry stole in the existing paper doll. Inventory, character and the live written HUD report cover/inspection/exposure.
- Ordinary non-boss Proctors and Legionnaires accept covered travellers at a distance. Inspection requires clear sight within 2.4 units, accumulates over three seconds (double at noise 4+), and decays by 0.75 seconds per second outside inspection. Panels pause inspection. Dead, hidden, passive and stunned patrols cannot inspect. Active combat, body-alarm searches, bosses, monsters, mechanical/story locks and wanted-player arrest retain their existing priority. Covered patrols still follow distractions.
- Witnessed attacks (even missed swings), loud/offensive Songs, successful throws, body dragging and visible clothing changes set the existing saved boolean flag `disguise:exposed:<area>` and alert visible ordinary Synod patrols. Unseen or unavailable actions and quiet murmurs do not expose cover. Changing robes or leaving/re-entering cannot clear exposure; other areas retain independent cover. New games reset flags; saves preserve equipped robes/exposure and reset only transient suspicion. Hostile flag text is never rendered or treated as a boolean exposure.
- Syntax, hostile-save security tests and the full Chromium suite pass with no runtime errors. Browser tests cover inspection timing/noise/decay/occlusion, paused HUD, listener exclusions, combat/body-alarm/monster/boss/arrest priority, witnessed/unseen acts, trade price and inventory Wear, paper-doll update, keyboard/touch/simulated-controller flows, missing/stale actions, compact-panel overflow, combined Body/Cover touch bounds, save/revisit and old-save defaults. Note-puzzle status selectors are now scoped to their modal rather than the new HUD live region; assertions remain intact. Screenshots: `/tmp/octave-disguise-panel.png`, `/tmp/octave-disguise-small.png`, `/tmp/octave-disguise-inventory.png`, `/tmp/octave-disguise-touch.png` (verification artifacts only).
- Physical-controller hardware, human visual/audio review and extended stealth balance remain unverified. Disguise eligibility is deliberately limited to the two baseline Synod patrol types, not a general faction-reputation system. Inspection is a timed proximity mechanic rather than a dialogue/password minigame. No production deployment or automatic PR merge is included; verified changes are pushed on a feature branch as requested.

### Body-handling pass verification
- Settled physical collapse visuals are selectable via a separate facing/range/line-of-sight check; Engine picking remains unchanged, so low corpses cannot steal loot interaction or block movement. Sinking/scattering/dissolving remains cannot be dragged. Dragging follows with a short trailing gap, half walking speed, no sprint and additional movement noise; collision sampling stops at solid props, closed doors and water.
- Nonblocking shrouded recesses append after historical entities in Oakhaven, the Quarry and the Cloister. Placement uses deterministic clear floor away from occupied props, spawns, doors and triggers. Concealment hides the body from patrols, and it can be recovered during the same visit.
- Discovery is checked every 0.25 simulation seconds: visible exposed bodies within six units alert eligible constables and ordinary humanoid patrols. Nearby visible allies within ten units search the discovery location for 12 seconds. Each body alarms once; hidden/dead/passive/stunned patrols and bosses do not join. Combat and visible wanted players remain higher priority; distractions cannot replace a body-search target. Body discovery alone does not create a bounty; a constable seeing the player actively drag one reports +20 once per body.
- Kill rewards and floor loot remain separate and cannot be duplicated by handling remains. Drag references reset on death/new game/departure/load; all corpse visuals and concealed bodies retain the existing transient lifecycle. Enemy death and loot save normally; body metadata is never imported or serialized. Older saves receive the appended recesses without changing save version.
- Syntax, hostile-save security tests and the full Chromium suite pass with no browser runtime errors. Regressions cover inspection/cancellation, facing/walls, prop/door/water clipping, slower movement/no sprint, hiding/recovery, local alarms/one-time bounty/threat priority, unchanged loot/rewards, stale callbacks, departure/reload/death, old saves and keyboard/touch/simulated-controller actions. Compact panel overflow and touch-button bounds are checked; screenshots: `/tmp/octave-body-panel.png`, `/tmp/octave-body-small.png`, `/tmp/octave-body-touch.png` (verification artifacts, not source).
- An existing puzzle no-cost regression fixture now starts at full Voice/Fatigue so passive regeneration between panel interactions cannot make exact-equality checks timing-dependent; no assertion was weakened. Physical-controller hardware, human visual/audio review and extended stealth balance remain unverified. Recesses reuse crate artwork; bodies are not persisted across area visits and patrol search navigation is limited to existing collision/sliding rather than full pathfinding.

### Throwable-distraction pass verification
- New travellers start with three `pebble` items and two `empty_bottle` items. Additional supplies append after historical Oakhaven entities at the square and east of the tavern for existing saves; no entity reordering or save-version change. Carried supplies can also be used from Inventory; the existing `bottle` (Vox-Bottle) remains unchanged.
- Forward aim is sampled to 5/7 units with wall and solid-body clipping; a blocked short throw consumes nothing. Successful throws consume exactly one item and apply a 0.75-second simulation-time cooldown, a brief nonblocking impact marker and written/audio feedback. No damage and no noise increase at the thrower location.
- Idle constables and ordinary non-boss enemies investigate a 7/11-unit sound radius (35% through walls), walking toward the impact and waiting until the 6/9-second investigation expires. Chasing, passive, hidden, dead, stunned and boss listeners are excluded. Seeing/hearing the player or taking a weapon/Song hit overrides investigation; constables prioritize visible wanted players and retain fine/jail behavior.
- Investigation targets and impact markers are transient; map departure clears them and imported `investigate` states normalize to idle. Inventory consumption persists normally. Inspection/cancellation, blocked throws and unavailable inventory spend nothing.
- Syntax, hostile-save security regressions and the full Chromium suite pass, including starting supplies, consumable counts, wall/body clipping, no source-noise/Vox changes, listener exclusions, movement/expiry, threat and hit priority, wall muffling, cooldown, departure/reload and actual keyboard/touch/simulated-controller controls. `/tmp/octave-distractions.png` records the throw panel. Physical-controller testing, human visual/audio review and long-form balance remain unverified; thrown flight artwork and navigation around complex obstacle mazes are not implemented.

### Pickpocketing pass verification
- Static purse IDs and fixed loose coin (4 sovereigns for townsfolk, 8 for merchants) are attached to existing Oakhaven adults without reordering/appending map entities. Children, companions, guards, night-watch extras and non-town NPCs are excluded; the Greening disables town theft.
- Inspection requires facing a visible living target within 1.65 units and clear line of sight. It costs nothing and pauses like other inspection panels. Front/side/rear is relative to the NPC heading; conversations turn their attention toward the player. Stealth improves odds; noise and frontal attention worsen them. Odds remain between 5% and 90%.
- An attempt records `pocket:oakhaven:<stable ID>` as `taken` or `caught` before awarding fixed gold or bounty. Success trains Stealth; every attempt counts as theft. The owner is excluded from the third-party witness scan; a caught owner always reports. Existing constable/fine/jail behavior handles the resulting bounty.
- Chromium covers front/rear/side risk, noise and skill effects, conversation attention, range/facing/walls, hidden/dead/companion/guard exclusions, cancellation, success/failure, witness reports, duplicate attempts, saved success/failure, old-save defaults, stale callbacks, keyboard/touch/simulated-controller inputs, and compact-panel overflow. Screenshots: `/tmp/octave-pickpocket.png` and `/tmp/octave-pickpocket-small.png` (verification artifacts, not source files).
- Physical-controller hardware testing and human visual/balance review remain outstanding; expanding purse placement beyond Oakhaven is not included in this pass.

### Cloister note-lock & Catacombs physical-puzzles pass verification
- Optional nonblocking reliquary appends after existing Cloister entities at (16.5, 12.5), and Catacombs physical puzzles append after existing Catacombs entities without altering story doors or save version.
- Drowned-chapel pressure plate at (4.5, 25.5) activates on player proximity or via the ballast-block inspection panel, opening the counter-weight niche at (10, 26) and granting one Light-Glass Shard and Lore progress once.
- Niche-gallery turning mirrors at (14.5, 2.5), (22.5, 2.5) and (22.5, 1.5) route a green-gold beam from (14.5, 4.5) to the eastern lens at (26.2, 1.5), updating in-world light segments and opening the prismatic niche at (27, 1) with a one-time shard and Lore reward.
- In-world interactions support keyboard (`1–3`, arrows, `Enter`/`Space`, `R`/`L`, `Escape`), touch buttons and Gamepad (`D-pad`, `A`, `X`, `B`) with written status descriptions and zero Voice/Fatigue cost.
- Chromium verifies in-world interaction, stepping onto the pressure plate, ballast toggling, mirror beam routing, reset/re-solve idempotence, keyboard/touch/controller inputs, save/load persistence and old-save defaults.
- Existing browser, security and gameplay smoke regressions pass. Audio listening quality, human visual review and physical-controller hardware testing remain unverified. Dedicated puzzle sprite sheets remain later polish.

### Dungeon-trap pass verification
- Three nonblocking mechanisms append after historical Catacombs entities, away from story triggers and the entrance. They reuse grate/web/bell artwork and advertise inspection in their labels.
- Proximity activation consumes a trap before applying its effect; spent or disarmed traps cannot retrigger. Nets use the existing movement-slow timer; bells alert nearby active, nonpassive enemies.
- Inspection describes consequences and opens the existing keyboard/touch/controller lockpicking panel for disarming. Leaving or failing three times does not silently disarm or activate a trap.
- Existing map/target flags retain `triggered`/`disarmed` states without changing save version. Old saves lacking flags start with armed mechanisms.
- Chromium verifies inspection/cancel, failed/successful disarm, placements, all three effects, one-shot damage and spent/disarmed reload behavior. Existing browser/security/smoke checks pass. Human visual review and physical-controller testing remain pending.

### Crime-foundation pass verification
- Crime data (bounty, theft count, served hours) uses existing saved player data and normalizes imported values; old saves default to no crime. New town entities append after historical world extras to preserve entity-index ordering.
- Only the explicitly owned market honey invokes theft confirmation; cancellation and unowned loot create no theft, and duplicate pickup cannot duplicate stolen goods.
- Chromium verifies witnessed/unwitnessed theft, hidden witnesses and wall occlusion, bounty save/load, guard pursuit/intervention, insufficient funds, exact fine deduction, refusal/grace and jail release.
- Jail advances world time six hours, clears the bounty and preserves all inventory/quest equipment. It is a time-served resolution, not yet a playable prison map.
- Existing lockpicking, visual, death, weapon/fire, hostile-save and gameplay smoke regressions pass. Human visual review and long-form balance playtesting remain outstanding.

### Lockpicking pass verification
- Unlocks use existing `G.flags` keys per map/target; no save-version change. Missing Lockpicking skill in old saves defaults to 15.
- Chromium verifies real vestry interaction and a complete keyboard solve, touch button input, controller press/release edges, cancellation, three-slip failure and skill-dependent tolerance.
- Locked strongboxes pay nothing before success or on cancellation; dead/hidden chest guards prevent duplicate loot. Story `cell.locked` gates are never pickable.
- Save/load retains door unlock flags. Success advances progress or increases rank at the existing skill threshold. Existing browser, hostile-save and gameplay smoke regressions pass.
- Visual art review and physical-controller hardware testing remain outstanding; controller polling is tested with a browser Gamepad API fixture.

### Weapon-motion and fire pass verification
- Chromium exercises all 16 weapon overlays at five progress points, four motion families, mirrored slashes and resting sequence endpoints.
- Pure pose evaluation leaves combat state unchanged; the real `attack()` entrypoint retains its catalog cooldown, fatigue cost and duplicate-input lock. Damage/hit logic is unchanged.
- Campfire and hearth each have four distinct cached frames; source pixels and fuel-bed pixels remain unchanged. The renderer resolver advances frames with the animation clock.
- Existing direction, equipment, lighting, corpse and save/load browser regressions remain passing. These are transformed existing assets, not bespoke painted swing/fire sheets; art review remains outstanding.

### Combat-life pass verification
- Generated death artwork is cached by source/view and pose (three collapse poses or eight special poses), not allocated every frame or for every body.
- Real `killEnemy` regression confirms rewards once, one body per death, corpse picking disabled, persistent opaque final pose and no collision.
- All 26 catalog species pass death-art/cache/termination checks in Chromium; Hollow water/dry transitions and both scattering swarm species have dedicated assertions.
- Real `snapshotGame`/`restoreGame` preserves killed enemy state while omitting transient body artwork. Existing save version is unchanged; corpses intentionally do not survive reload.
- Area transfer clears session corpse/effect entities immediately; returning cannot resurrect them. Final hand-painted collapse art, directional species expansion, weapon sheets and drawn fire are still pending.
- Browser assertions and screenshots are not a substitute for human visual art review. No low-end performance claim has been made.

### Current pass acceptance
- Keep `index.html` script order and existing save schema compatible; no new dependencies or services.
- Direction choice uses enemy heading, not camera heading; mirror only opposite oblique views, retain animation poses and safe fallback for species without sheets.
- Glass emitters illuminate the existing wall/floor renderer and stop emitting when hidden/dead.
- Inventory doll reflects all five armour slots, selected weapon, portrait and two-handed shield suppression; HTML uses only validated catalog data.
- Verify syntax, hostile-save regression, directional octants, doll gear variants and lighting render output. Do not count headless DOM stubs as visual inspection.

## Domain Roadmaps

### 1. World & Exploration
- `[x]` **World Map & Fast Travel (`T`)**: Fills in as you explore; travel between discovered waypoints with Cautious/Reckless ambush risk.
- `[x]` **Weather System**: Rain, thick fog banks, and ash/snow in the Deep Woods — dynamically modifies how far your noise carries in the Narrow and how far enemies can see.
- `[x]` **More Indoor Buildings & Lore Bookshelves**: Enterable Oakhaven houses (the Baker's, the Chandler's, the Buyer's House on Cooper's Row) with readable bookshelves containing series bible lore volumes.
- `[x]` **Resonant & Breakable Secret Walls**: Hidden chambers behind cracked masonry or resonant stone that only open when struck or sung to with the right frequency.
- `[x]` **Swimming & Climbing**: Wade and swim through drowned sections in Whisper-Grove and the Under-hedge (managing breath/fatigue), and climb steep ledges/walls using your Climbing skill.
- `[x]` **Distant Landmarks**: Silhouette rendering on the horizon for the Dawning Spire, the Quarry Headframe, the Cloister Belfry, and the Mausoleum Tower.
- `[x]` **Ambient Life**: Birds, rats, wandering villagers, market stalls, and night watchmen on patrol.
- `[x]` **Foraging, Fishing & Harvesting**: Gather willow-bark, reed-pith, and moon-moss; fish at the Flume crossing and sunken pools; harvest raw Light-glass shards from glassrock veins.

### 2. Combat
- `[x]` **Directional Melee (Daggerfall-style)**: Drag the mouse to choose **Thrust** (high accuracy, armor-piercing), **Slash Left/Right** (wide arc, bonus vs unarmored), or **Chop Down / Cut Up** (high damage, bonus stagger, lower accuracy).
- `[x]` **Blocking & Parrying (`Right-Click` / `F`)**: Raise your weapon or shield to block; time it within the parry window during an enemy's `_a1` wind-up frame to deflect the blow and stagger the attacker.
- `[x]` **Enemy Weak Points**: Aim high or thrust accurately to strike the Steam Golem's open furnace, the Aegis Sentinel's violet chest-core, or a Proctor's hand-press.
- `[x]` **Status Effects**:
  - **Bleeding**: Damage over time until bandaged or tended.
  - **Deafened**: Cannot cast Songs or hear enemy audio cues.
  - **Hushed**: Noise locked near zero — accelerates Unwriting in siphoned areas.
  - **Frightened**: Reduced attack accuracy and trembling view.
- `[x]` **Expanded Ranged Weapons**: Rust Coast Crossbow, Glass-Shot Pistol, and **Throwing Knives** (silent, fast, retrievable).
- `[x]` **Stealth Kills**: Backstab unaware (`idle`) enemies from behind for 3× critical damage (4× with Carder's Knife or throwing knives).
- `[x]` **Enemy Morale**: Humanoid enemies call nearby allies on alert, flee at low health, and may surrender (offering sovereigns, lore, or their name for the Ledger).
- `[x]` **Boss Phases**: The Wearer, the Requiem, the Phantom Weaver, and the Brood-Mother shift tactics, summon aid, or alter frequencies at 50% health.
- `[x]` **Elite Named Enemies**: Veteran Legionnaires, Arch-Proctors, and Elder Hounds with distinct names, golden aura tint, higher stats, and guaranteed rare loot.

### 5. Quests & Story
- `[~]` **Series Bible Side Quests** (The Year 417 is built; the other two are not):

### 6. Companions
- `[~]` **Companion Approval** (partial: approval is tracked and banked from talk, but nothing reads it yet; no perks, combos or leaving): Kaelen, Lyra, and Sable react to your mercy, ruthlessness, and Ledger choices; high approval unlocks personal perks and combo attacks, while very low approval can make them return to camp.
- `[x]` **Party Banter**: Contextual exchanges between Kaelen, Lyra, and Sable as you travel.

- `[x]` **Distinct Enemy Sound Sets**: Idle, alert, attack, hurt, and death sound synthesis per enemy family.
- `[~]` **Kaelen Humming the Root Note**: When Kaelen is badly hurt (<35% HP), a low 174 Hz hum rises under the audio mix while he holds his chest, just as described in the series bible. (A Phase 4 audit found this had been marked done with no code behind it; it was built in `js/companions.js`. The Dissonant Blade player's version is not built.)
- `[x]` **Dynamic Alert Music Swell**: Music swells in tension when enemies spot you and fades smoothly back when you break line of sight.

### 8. Visuals

- `[x]` **Shop Tooltips & Item Comparison**: Side-by-side stat deltas (`+AR`, `+dmg`, `noise`, `weight`) when browsing merchants or inventory.
- `[x]` **In-Game Bestiary & Lore Codex**: Automatically records all 26 enemy types as you encounter/defeat them (with their drawn sprite frames and weaknesses) plus series bible lore entries and tracked Achievements.

### 10. Technical & Platform Notes
