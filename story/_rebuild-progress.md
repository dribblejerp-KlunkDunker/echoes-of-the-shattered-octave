# Handoff: finish the bundle + GitHub rebuild

*Written 19 Oct 2026 by the session that pushed commits 979b0c6 and c242dfe.*

## The goal

Get every piece of written work for *Echoes of the Shattered Octave* into two places:
this repo (durable, the point of the exercise) and a packaged zip of markdown + PDFs for
sleeves to download. Nothing is to be lost.

## Already done — do not redo

Pushed to `main` under `story/`:

- `Books/Book One - The Silenced Province/` — full manuscript + all 26 chapters split out
- `Books/Book Two - The Great Discord/Part One Ch1-3.md`
- `World Bibles/Series Bible (canon).md`
- `World Bibles/Vol VII - The Calendar of Aethelgard.md`
- `Source Material/` — the four original source documents, unedited, plus a README
- `tooling/vite-scaffold/` — build scaffold salvaged from the retired
  `The-Shattered-Octave-Updated-` repo (that repo holds nothing else unique; sleeves will
  delete it himself — repo deletion is blocked from these sessions)

## What is left: 16 project docs

They live in the attached claude.ai Project "Shattered Octave", not on disk. Fetch each with
the `Projects` tool, `method: "project_read"`, using the exact path.

**Known constraint, learned the hard way: subagents in this environment do NOT get the
`Projects` tool.** Fetching cannot be delegated — the main session must do it. Each doc costs
roughly 25k tokens round trip (it returns inline, then you write it to disk). Budget for that,
work in small batches, and commit + push after each batch so progress survives a compaction.

## Then: the zip for sleeves

`story/tools/build_bundle.py` builds PDFs from markdown with wkhtmltopdf and stamps page
numbers with pypdf + reportlab. **It was written for the previous session's container and its
`ROUTES`/`main()` expect docs in `/mnt/user-data/outputs/projectdocs/` and an existing bundle
folder to restructure. In a fresh container neither exists, so adapt it:** point it at the
repo's `story/` tree as input, write PDFs beside each markdown file (or into a build dir), then
zip markdown + PDFs as `Shattered Octave Books.zip` and send it with `SendUserFile`.

Notes on the PDF build that are worth keeping: wkhtmltopdf's `--footer-center [page]` is
silently ignored by the installed unpatched-Qt build, which is why page numbers are stamped
afterwards; `pip install` needs `--break-system-packages`; Letter page size with 22/20/24/24mm
margins and DejaVu Serif 11.5pt justified is the house style, with a page break before each
`h2`.

## Standing decisions, so nothing gets re-litigated

- Books go in **this public repo** — sleeves was told plainly the drafts become publicly
  readable and chose it anyway. Don't reopen it.
- Markdown is the source of truth; PDFs are generated artifacts.
- Canon: the trilogy ends on the **Resonant Accord**; character deaths follow **no death
  without an heir**; Book Two's action register is **kinetic, legible, lethal**. All three are
  written up in the Series Bible.
- Where a world bible and the Source Material disagree, the Source Material is ground truth.
