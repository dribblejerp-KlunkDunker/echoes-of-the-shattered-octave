//  cargo56 — Cargo night (Book One ch. 8, ll. 2561–2818; ROADMAP R9 item 14).
//
//  The Drift-Kestrel is moored at Oakhaven's mast; its mast-ladder (js/maps.js, use 'crates') has always shown the crates
//  in her hold. On Driftday night (game day 6) and the dead hour after it, the ladder plays the chapter instead:
//    * STALL THE CLERK (Driftday, 19:00 to midnight). The paymaster's clerk comes up the ladder to count the crates, and the
//      Carders are on deck. Mags needs a count of twenty to get them into the sail-locker. Give it to her by talking: three
//      rounds, two safe things to talk about and one that turns his eye toward the bow. Twice wrong and Vane takes over
//      [PROPOSED: the juggle as play; the topics are the book's]. Then the child's boot by the third crate: put your own
//      boot over it (canon). He counts twelve. "They do carry on, don't they." "My first posting was the harvest-house at
//      Whisper-Grove."
//    * THE THIRD CRATE (the dead hour, game day 7 before 05:00). Pim with his ear to the wood, talking to Annet. Vane prises
//      the lid; WG-41,004 on the tag. He does not laugh. Pennick's slate: six; then everything over the side, the
//      brandy, the chain, the long gun last, and it is eighteen. "Annet. You're going home." Vane says it, or lets you.
//    * THE LONG GUN. "Tomorrow, in the dark, over the slag-pit, so nobody hears the splash." You carry the lock and the
//      shot down to Depot Three's slag-slope (js/tamsin52.js) and send them over (R6's "Vane's long gun in the quarry mud").
//  Missing either night changes nothing but lines: the old crates card still plays. Flags: p56 (1 the clerk stalled, 2 the
//  crate opened, 9 missed), p56_clerk (1 you held him, 2 Vane had to), p56_boot (1 covered, 2 picked up, 3 left), p56_say
//  (1 Vane said it, 2 you did), p56_gun (1 carried, 2 over the slope).
