// ============================================================
//  companion-talk — Phase 9 (new gameplay systems): real conversations with your companions.
//
//  A "Talk" panel in the style of the dialogue panel (same .dlg frame, portrait and log): a topic list that grows
//  with what has happened, each topic a short branching exchange of two to four beats, with two or three replies
//  in different tones. Some replies move the companion's approval through the game's own partyApproval(); a few
//  topics earn one small permanent thing that already exists in the game: a title (earnTitle), a line at the rest
//  fire (partyBark), a line out on the road (partyChat), a logbook entry (journal). No combat power is added.
//
//  Who you can talk to
//    * your active companion, from the party panel (E on them) or the Talk button on the party HUD: Kaelen, Lyra, Sable
//    * the same people at the Whisper-Grove and Deep Woods camps, when they stand there as NPCs (a Talk... button in
//      the ordinary dialogue panel): Kaelen, Lyra, Sable (only once she is with you), Vane, and the calmed Aegis
//  Only when it is calm: never with a foe chasing nearby, in a fight with a Coda boss, in custody or on the bore escape.
//
//  Gates read (existing game flags only; the module never writes one):
//    kaelen_met coil_done part3 part4 greening hedge_answered hedge_silent hedge_listened tobin_417_done
//    lyra_met lyra_wg_met lyra_dw_met lyra_voice kaelen_dw_done kaelen_told_now
//    sable_met sable_wg_met sable_with sable_joined sable_aboard sable_returned bettis_awake quist_press quist_sable
//    aegis_calmed aegis_follow cloak_given dw_vane_met vane_wg_met vane_told crates_heard tank_patched
//    bottles_done coda_done vane_vesper
//  and the party object (G.party.id). Sable's "what have you paid" reads the two flags sableFragments() counts
//  (sable_returned, bettis_awake).
//
//  Memory (G.flags, all small integers, validated on read; anything else counts as 0):
//    p9t_t  talked-topic bits   (Kaelen 0-5, Lyra 8-13, Sable 16-20, Vane 22-25, Aegis 27-28; 29 bits)
//    p9t_u  unlock bits          (which small permanent things were earned)
//    p9t_a  approval banked from talk, three 5-bit fields (Kaelen, Lyra, Sable), each -16..+15, stored +16
//  The game keeps approval only on the live G.party object, which is not saved and is rebuilt on every
//  partyJoin; the bank re-applies what talk earned (silently) when a companion joins or a save is restored.
//
//  Lyra's voice follows voices.js exactly (VOICES.resolveNpc when it is loaded, the same flag rules otherwise):
//  silent from Whisper-Grove until lyra_voice, so she answers on her slate in capitals; with the voice back she speaks
//  "in her own ruined voice"; before Whisper-Grove she speaks plainly.
//
//  Switch: "Companion conversations" in Options > Graphics & access (default On, localStorage octave.ctalk.v1).
//  Off = the original game: no Talk button, no extra lines.
//
//  Security: every sentence comes from the constant tables below and is set with textContent; flag and save values only
//  choose among those tables and are never printed. The panel's frame markup is constant.
//  Anything marked [PROPOSED] is invented beyond the game's text and LORE_P6 and needs the author's eye.
