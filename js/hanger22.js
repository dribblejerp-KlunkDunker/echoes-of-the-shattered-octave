//  hanger22 — Phase 22b, "What Bleats in the Wood": the Watch Downs region gets its dark.
//
//  Builds on js/sheepwalk22.js (Wethercombe, the flock, the Ram, the fold-fires). [PROPOSED] throughout.
//    * THE WOOLWIGHT. Something has been pulling the wool out of the Hedge's roots, a fleece at a time, and wearing it:
//      a tall heap of grey fleeces with three sheep's heads at the wrong heights. It bleats like a ewe that has lost her
//      lamb, and it can throw its voice. It hunts by night on the open maps of the region (Wethercombe, the Downs, the
//      Hanger), and it will not come into firelight: lit fold-fires, lanterns and a camp fire keep it off. By day it
//      goes back into the wood. This keeps the ruling: nothing took the sheep. Something took the wool.
//    * THE HANGER (p22_hanger), a steep dark beech wood south of Wethercombe, joined to Wethercombe only (a gap in its
//      south hedge). The Woolwight's nest, a tree hung with snagged Hedge-wool, a pool with glass-eels, a charcoal
//      burners' ring, lambkins (balls of wool on twig legs) and hounds.
//    * EWE BARROW (p22_barrow), the long barrow under the sarsen in Wethercombe: deadly, trapped, five chambers of grave
//      goods, Woolwights and lambkins, and in the last chamber the Old Fleece. The sarsen moves only when the Ram is
//      white and the three fold-fires burn ("when the Ram is white and the fires burn, the barrow gives back").
//    * QUESTS: "Bleating in the Wood" (find what wears the wool) and "The Lambing at Night" (Kit Farrant follows a bleat
//      into the dark: the cap at the nest, the barrow, the Old Fleece, and Kit).
//    * NEW GEAR: Farrant's Crook, Shearing Blades, the Barrow-Bronze Leaf Blade; the Barrow-Warden's Helm, the
//      Hedge-Wool Shroud, Drover's Boots; grave goods (a gold torc, amber beads, a bronze lunula), Hedge-wool.
//    * CAMP AND FISH ANYWHERE: the Drover's Camp Kit pitches a fire and a bedroll where you stand on any open-country map
//      (the fire cooks, as js/hearth15.js's camp fires do; the bedroll sleeps you through the night); the Drover's
//      Fishing Line casts into any water: stand still, strike on the bite. Trout, perch and, by night, glass-eels.
//
//  State: G.flags only, prefix p22h_ (quests) and p22c_ (the camp), small integers validated on every read. Hunting
//  Woolwights, the camp's fire and bedroll, the cap at the nest are TRANSIENT (never saved). The two new maps are built
//  deterministically and their baseCount set once; Wethercombe gains one door cell.
//  Rules kept: wrappers only; no markup from save data; presentation randomness from a private generator (the hunt's
//  spawn rolls too, so the game's own random stream is never drawn by this module).
