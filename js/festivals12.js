// ============================================================
//  festivals12 — Phase 12 (festivals of the Reach), team FESTIVALS.
//  The author's FESTIVALS_CANON ruling: festivals follow the crop, the river and the weather, are kept by a village,
//  use folk tunes, and never appear on an Office docket. Four of them are in Book One. One switch, Options ->
//  Graphics & access -> "Festivals" (default On, localStorage 'octave.festivals12.v1'). Off = the game as before:
//  no prop, no person, no line, no wrapped behaviour that does anything.
//
//   1. THE LAST SHEAF (Harvest Home). Day 2 (Hearthday the eighth of Harvestmonth) a sheaf is hung on the Hedge-gate
//      [PROPOSED date]; Oakhaven prepares (bunting, small sheaves on the lamp-posts, a harvest table in the square with
//      hearth bread, cider and moot-curd, townsfolk talk, the Sheaf Song hummed in the Boar). Day 4 (Stasisday the
//      tenth) [PROPOSED] the Church postpones it: a notice is nailed under the sheaf, the bunting comes down, and the
//      Synod Gazette prints a line. The north field (the NE corner inside the Hedge, [PROPOSED]) keeps its last stand uncut.
//   2. SIDE QUEST "The Last Sheaf". After the postponement and before the Greening, Old Harrow (who hung the sheaf)
//      asks you to help cut it in secret. At the dead hour (04:00-06:00, the hour before dawn) Dunna Sedge and four
//      villagers are in the north field. You must be quiet (G.noise low) to begin, and then cut on every beat of the
//      Sheaf Song: sixteen beats, a din meter that rises with ragged and stray strokes. Too loud and a Church patrol walks
//      the hedge-lane: the cut is abandoned for the night, no punishment. Reward: the Plaited Sheaf-Figure, a loaf and a
//      jug, a small Hedge standing bump, a journal entry. Declining, missing it, or the Greening coming first is fine
//      (the closing line is "The sheaf was still standing in the north field.").
//   3. THE RITE AS FALSE FESTIVAL. While the Rite is staged (flags rite_started, or rite_ready and day >= 10) and the
//      Greening has not come: white banners, censer smoke, a herald at the crossroads, a compulsory-gathering notice and
//      a set of sermon lines. Presentation only: no quest flag is read for anything but "is it on", none is written.
//   4. THE EEL-RUN. The night of day 6 (Driftday the twelfth) [PROPOSED]: lanterns on stakes along the Flume crossing,
//      trappers on the bank, and a quiet fishing variant at the existing fishing spot: cast, stand still, and haul on
//      the bite. Noise above the quiet limit startles the eels. Six eels at most (small validated integer).
//   5. THE DROWNED LANTERNS. After the Greening, the first night spent in Whisper-Grove [PROPOSED]: lanterns on the lit
//      water and a basket of blank ones at the edge. Set one for a name from your ledger or the people you have met
//      or read of (never markup: names are cleaned and shown with textContent), or for "the ones not written down".
//
//  Saved state: G.flags p12f_ only, small validated integers (see FLAGS): p12f_q quest stage (0 none, 1 asked and
//  accepted, 2 cut, 3 closed by the Greening), p12f_ask offered once, p12f_try day+1 of the last abandoned cut,
//  p12f_hung the figure is on the gate, p12f_seen the sheaf was seen, p12f_eel eels taken in the run, p12f_dl day+1 of
//  the first day spent in the Grove after the Greening, p12f_dls lanterns set. Anything else under that prefix is
//  dropped on load. Props and people are transient (never saved) and rebuilt from the flags and the clock.
//  Wrapped (never edited): loadMap, restoreGame, update, talk, useDeco, useItem, showEvent, renderAccessibilityMenu.
//  Every invented fact is marked [PROPOSED]; all player-visible text is in TX (registered through S()).
