// ============================================================
//  governor46 — Release road R5 #5: the Governor's house, above the square (Book One ch. 2).
//
//    * THE HOUSE: the north-row door beside the Greenhall that stood shuttered once the Carders moved behind the tannery
//      (js/hollow30.js). Kaelen's birthplace (data.js: "born in the Governor's house above the square"). The step Aldric
//      stood on the winter Kaelen came home, and the gate Kaelen stood at: "the town told it both ways" (ch. 2). A long
//      table laid for one. Marrit Pell, the housekeeper [PROPOSED: her name and her part], who airs the room.
//    * ALDRIC'S HIDDEN ROOTS (ch. 2: "beneath the linen's edge, pale as a grub, a root-tip ... The Grafters are discreet
//      with the Governor. Twice a month, now"): his dressing-table, with the basin, the linen squares cut to a thumb's
//      width, the comb, the hand-glass turned face down, and the Grafters' note [PROPOSED wording]. His desk: the lease
//      worn soft at the signature, and the winter's list in his own hand ("the Wetherby twins, and the Hale girl, and the
//      miller's three, and eleven more").
//    * THE AIRED ROOM (ch. 2: "Your room's as you left it. I had them air it every spring."): the bed made, the window
//      open on the latch on a day that is not spring, a boy's drawings of bores ("You drew the pictures, boy"), the
//      Conservatory's letter in a frame, and a coat on the peg.
//    * "THE COAT ON THE PEG" [PROPOSED: the errand, from the Story Brainstorm §16]: once you have seen the room, Aldric
//      asks you to take the coat out to the hut and leave it on the step. Kaelen leaves it there, unopened, and says
//      nothing. Tell Aldric, and he says "No. I didn't think he would." (Flag p46_coat; R9's Ash in the Hold reads it.)
//
//  Playable in Parts One and Two only, like everything new in Oakhaven: from the Greening on, the door is shut under the
//  green and the errand closes with one logbook line. The two maps are new and always built (a save may stand in one);
//  nothing draws on the random stream, and nothing is added to an old map's entity list (the parcel on the hut's step is
//  a transient entity, placed from the flags).
