//  malting61 — The Malting's front door and the Reach-displaced queue (ROADMAP R9 item 15; Book One ch. 18,
//  ll. 4874–5082; Story Brainstorm #15 and E12).
//
//  The Malting gets its queue-yard, a map between Whisper-Grove's Cloister road door and the Malting's front door:
//    * Sable's shelter, built to her own pamphlet: tarred canvas on a timber frame, forty feet by twelve; benches, a water
//      butt, the man at the trestle with the ticket-book, a clerk walking the line telling everyone, pleasantly, what will
//      be asked. The board: RELIEF STATION — REACH DISPLACED / FOOD · SHELTER · TRANSIT / REGISTRATION REQUIRED (canon).
//    * Under it, people in Reach clothes with Greening mud to the ankle (canon: two carters' smocks, a woman in the grey
//      apron of a dye-works; Ansel Hay, sluice-man on the Flume). [PROPOSED] Among them, Oakhaven's people (the ones who
//      kept the town's hours in js/life60-oakhaven.js): you meet them again four days later, being registered.
//    * The first time you come: the queue, Kaelen's "They walked", Sable's "Registration is the first room", the bell.
//      Then the plan (Vane's, not elegant), and Sable walks in the front. You choose your half:
//        (a) in at the front with Sable: the clerks' hall, the vinegar, Quist's eleven minutes and the desk; "Would you show
//            me a pressing?"; Pressing Room I and Ansel Hay, eight seconds of 741 (canon). You end in the press room with
//            her, where the core of Bettis Renn is on the west shelves (the Bettis scene is js/grove.js's, as before);
//        (b) round to the kiln end with Vane: in by the freight door, into the press room, which is still guarded;
//        (c) stay under the shelter and work the queue [PROPOSED as play]: tell people what is in the first room, and
//            each one you tell walks off into the orchard (one old man will not). Tell one where the clerk can hear, or
//            empty four places, and the clerk counts the benches and walks quickly to the front door: the bell rings
//            early, the hall is awake and the reserve is out when you go in.
//      In every case Sable is in the clerks' hall, so unless the clerk noticed, the hall's proctors are looking at her and
//      not at you (canon: "every person in that building who is not physically holding a subject will come and look").
//    * When the press is out and the bell has rung, the queue has scattered. Sable has a line for what you did to it.
//  Nothing fails. Flags: p61 (1 front, 2 kiln, 3 queue), p61_seen, p61_told (bits), p61_noticed, p61_after.
