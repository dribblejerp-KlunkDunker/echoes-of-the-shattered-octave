// ============================================================
//  rumours — Phase 6 (story reactivity), team RUMOURS.
//  1. Deed-sensitive tavern talk. Hetty Bram (the barman of the Boar & Dulcimer) and the
//     generic townsfolk (NPCS entries flagged `rumour: true`: the tavern patron and the
//     orchardmen and goodwives, including their tavern stand-ins) get one extra button in
//     the dialogue, "Any news?". It never touches NPCS, TOPICS or askTopic: the wrapper
//     only appends the button after renderDialogue has drawn the panel.
//  2. The Synod Gazette. A transient, non-solid notice-board sign on Oakhaven's street in
//     front of the Greenhall and the Chapel, and inside the Boar, opens a held document
//     (READING.SOURCES) in the flat Office voice. Its issue follows the story.
//  Switch: UPG.storyRumours (default true; GFX.storyRumours === false also turns it off).
//  Off = the original dialogue and street: no button, no signs, no flags written.
//  Honesty rules: a line is eligible ONLY when the flags (or crime record) prove the deed;
//  nothing is random (the choice is a pure function of the state, p6r_n and p6r_last);
//  quest flags are only ever read. The only things written are the integers p6r_n,
//  p6r_last and the boolean p6r_body (a patrol found a body: the game keeps that only on
//  a transient corpse, so it is remembered here). Every string shown comes from the
//  constant tables below; save data (flags, names, numbers) only selects among them and
//  numbers are clamped integers. Prose is written to LORE_P6.md; anything invented beyond
//  that brief is marked [PROPOSED].
