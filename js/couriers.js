// couriers — Phase 6 (story reactivity): letters from the people you helped.
// Owned by the COURIERS team; see ROADMAP.md ("Courier letters from helped NPCs").
//
// DELIVERY RULE (one rule, so players and tests can predict it):
//   A letter is written the moment you have done the deed (the quest flag exists).
//   It reaches you at the next "delivery moment" — you finish a rest, the day turns
//   over, or you arrive in a new area — provided the deed is at least MIN_WAIT game
//   seconds old (so it never lands on the same breath as the deed) and the sender is
//   still alive and in reach. One letter per moment, in table order, so several
//   deeds arrive as a trickle, not a flood. Nothing is delivered while a panel, a
//   cutscene or a death screen is up; the letter simply waits for the next moment.
//
// STATE lives only in G.flags keys "p6c_<id>": 1 once delivered. Anything else
// (strings, objects, NaN, negatives, huge numbers) reads as "not delivered", and is
// overwritten by 1 on delivery, so a hostile save can neither duplicate a letter
// nor put markup on screen: every word shown comes from the constant tables below.
// The deed flags are only ever tested for truthiness and never displayed.
//
// WHERE LETTERS LIVE: Logbook -> "Letters" (a compact list under "Other matters");
// a letter opens as a held paper document through READING.SOURCES (kind 'Letter').
//
// [PROPOSED] (not in the lore brief): the courier itself; the idea that townsfolk
// write rather than speak (in Oakhaven a spoken thanks carries); the loop-shaped
// letter for Halder Wick; every small gift.
