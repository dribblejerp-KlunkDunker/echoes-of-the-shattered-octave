// ============================================================
//  prologue17 — Phase 17 "Beyond Book One", team PROLOGUE: "Prologue: The River Gate".
//
//  An extra, after Book One. Rootday the nineteenth of Frostmonth, 419: Lyra Ashgrove, with no voice, walks the last
//  of the Greenroot road in snow and comes home to Oakhaven, which is a wood now. The scene is the author's own: Book
//  Four, Part One, Chapter Four ("The Root"), from the road to the river gate and Dorran Sedge, and it stops there,
//  before the square. WHY THIS MOMENT: Book Four says plainly that Lyra had not been inside the Hedge since the
//  Kestrel left in Harvestmonth ("She came through the river gate in the dark, and stood, and did not know where she
//  was"; Dorran: "They said you'd gone up in the airship"), and Book Two puts her on the Kestrel all through Ashfall.
//  The fallen leaves exist only from Nullday the eighteenth of Frostmonth. So the first evening the three set pieces
//  (the houses in the crowns, the leaves, the voice outside the Hedge) can be walked as Lyra without contradicting
//  Books Two to Four is this one. Everything after Dorran's "You'd best come and see the Governor" is left to the book.
//
//    * Two maps, registered from this module ONLY while the extra runs (a Book One game never builds them):
//        p17p_road  The Greenroot road from the second milestone to the grey Hedge, the North Gate (sealed), the path
//                   along the outside of the Hedge, the river and the river gate. Graves along the verges, set the Reach
//                   way (stone on the tongue, stone on the stone); some bare. The oaks do not ring.
//        p17p_wood  Oakhaven inside the river gate: the river street, leaves a foot deep and silent, great grey trunks
//                   with the houses carried up into their crowns. Dorran Sedge comes out of the trees with a lantern.
//    * PLAYING AS LYRA (no voice): what she says, she writes on the slate (event choices); she lifts her good hand; the
//      Song key whistles the tending note, thinly, and it hurts (Book Three: she "found out she could still whistle").
//      She does not hum and does not sing: the Rite took her voice (Book Two, Seraphina: "I'm told the Rite at Oakhaven
//      took it"). Her companions on the road are Book Four's: Seraphina, the Aegis, Ignatius Crane, Solenne. They follow
//      her, never block her (not solid), and help with the stones as the book says.
//    * No combat. Nothing here can hurt you; nothing can be failed. The horror is the graves and a voice in the thorn.
//    * ISOLATION: EXTRAS17 (js/extras17.js) runs start() inside its own session. This module writes only G.flags under
//      p17p_ in that session; every wrapper is inert unless this extra is running (active()). If EXTRAS17 is still the
//      contract stub, start()/finish() fall back to a plain session of their own and return to the title.
//
//  GAMEPLAY TABLE (B below): wading in the leaves x0.82 speed; companions keep about 1.2 u behind each other along your
//  own trail; Dorran walks at 1.35 u/s and waits if you are more than 4.5 u behind; companions set a stone on a bare
//  grave near them every 7 s once the Aegis has begun; the Song key whistles once per 6 s; time of day runs from
//  afternoon at the second milestone to dusk at the Hedge (by how far up the road you are) and is night in the wood.
//
//  STATE: G.flags under p17p_ only, small validated integers (FLAGS). Transient run state (RUN) is never saved.
//  Every invented name, place and fact is marked [PROPOSED]; the dialogue is the author's, from Book Four.
//  Art: procedural stand-ins (canvas painting, cached once); companions are recoloured / over-painted copies of the
//  game's own sprites. Security: event markup is built only from the constant TX table (escaped); nothing from a save.
