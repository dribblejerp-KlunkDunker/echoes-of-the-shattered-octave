// ============================================================
//  narrow28 — Release road R3, "The Narrow comes home": systems the game already has, made to matter.
//
//  Book One's rule is "too loud brings the hounds, too still brings the Hush". This module makes the town, the lamps, the
//  songs and the hounds keep it:
//    * HUSH-LAMPS. A lit hush-lamp within BAL.lampR stops the stillness timer (the Hush) on any map that has one. A
//      hush-whistle, blown outdoors or underground, is pushed into the ground on its stake and pipes on as a lamp for
//      BAL.plantSecs. (game.js useItem still gives its old 25 seconds of breath.)
//    * THE NARROW AS LAW inside the Hedge (lawActive maps; not the Boar, which keeps its own rules). Noise over BAL.breach
//      in a witness's sight gets the ward-sign; a second breach within BAL.warnHours is "a breach of the Narrow",
//      fined through reportCrime. Never while something is chasing you.
//    * SONGS LEARNED FROM PEOPLE, through Hold the Pitch (reedcraft.js), from a "Learn a song…" button in the dialogue
//      (the ledger15 Train… pattern): Lyra the Root note, Old Tam "The Miller's Daughter" (once you told him the truth
//      about the Flume), Bettany the tending breath (for coin). Tobin's notebook, page two, teaches the falling fifth
//      at his reed-pipes in Lyra's house. "The Miller's Daughter" is a new Song: loud, far above the Narrow, and every
//      hound in hearing goes to where it was sung (Book One, ch. 18: Tam in the water-meadow).
//    * HOUND PACKS. Hounds near one another run as a pack behind a leader (larger). A falling fifth that stops the
//      leader (your Song, or Lyra's whistle in party.js) routs the whole pack for BAL.routSecs.
//    * THREE CANON COMBAT RULES. Below BAL.fearAt health your breath is loud (a noise floor). A Quiet goes to a lit
//      lantern. Where a hound bursts, nothing carries for BAL.patchSecs: no Song, and nothing hears you or anyone in it.
//    * THE LISTENING HOUR. In Oakhaven at dusk a lamplighter walks the lanes and lights the hush-lamps one by one (by
//      day they are dark); night-hummers sit at three crossings till dawn; at the dead hour the shift changes with
//      "all's well, all's quiet, keep to the Narrow". All of it follows the clock, so a loaded game or slept hours agree.
//    * FACTION STANDING (canon's Concordance), fed once each by choices already made (Tam, Pim, Sable, the bottles; the
//      heists already move it). It moves shop prices, one line from Harrow and one from Hetty, and one line of Book
//      One's ending. No numbers on screen.
//
//  Nothing here draws on the game's random stream. Planted lamps, dead patches, the lure, the lamplighter and the
//  night-hummers are transient: never saved, so no saved entity index moves, and they are cleared before any map loads so
//  what runs on load sees the map as built. The only saved state is a few flags (n28_c_* for choices already counted,
//  n28_learn_* for lessons), which an old save simply lacks. The tick rides inside updateNarrow (the game's own update),
//  and on a co-op guest it does nothing: the host runs the world.
