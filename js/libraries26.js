// libraries26 — Phase 26, the libraries of the Reach: four rooms full of books you can walk into, their keepers,
// and the books they are missing. The books themselves are js/library26.js's catalogue (LIBRARY).
//
//   The Conservatory Reading Room   Oakhaven, Parts 1–2. Kept by Cantor-Master Ilse Brennan, who lost her voice to
//                                   the Debt of Overtone and teaches by writing (Vol II, People). Her quest: the
//                                   Conservatory's books lent out before the Hedge closed. Reward: the tending breath.
//   The Bonded Store                Stillwater Landing, Parts 1–2: where Cantabile broadsheets come in (Vol II).
//                                   Kept by Odile Quayle, book-runner [PROPOSED], who sells. Her quest: a wet crate.
//   The Moot-house                  Whisper-Grove, Part 3: the plaza's fourth side (Book One). Books whose owners lost
//                                   their names; a Hollow still shelves them. Names on the flyleaves go into your Ledger.
//   The Scriptorium of the Veil     The House of the Silent Veil (the game's Mausoleum), Part 4: first floor, east end,
//                                   sloped desks and a stove at each end (Vol V). No keeper.
//  Everything placed here is part of the maps' base build (new maps; one door cell changed on each host), so saves
//  keep working: G.flags only ('libq_*' booleans, 'libret:<id>'). [PROPOSED]: the Conservatory's place in Oakhaven,
//  Odile Quayle, the Bonded Store, the Moot-house library, the shelver. Switch: UPG.library (shared with LIBRARY).
