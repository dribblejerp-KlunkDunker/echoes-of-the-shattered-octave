// ============================================================
//  heist16 — Phase 16 "New ground", team HEIST: two optional night jobs.
//
//  1. THE HELD LETTERS [PROPOSED] (the Church). There is no Synod cathedral in the Reach; the Church's house in Oakhaven is
//     the Chapel of the Carillon, and Gazette No. 32 says that messages between the Cantor and parties beyond the Hedge
//     "may be left at the Chapel, where they will be held". They are held: in the undercroft below the vestry, in one
//     sealed cabinet. A new map, "The vestry and undercroft" (p16h_vestry), is reached by a low door in the Chapel's west
//     wall. A Proctor warden walks the archive in a loop; lamps make pools of light; the back stair is dark.
//       PLAN   Dessa Quill (new, on the Chapel steps) tells three things, one at a time: the Warden's rounds (ROUTE), when
//              the Chapel is singing (WINDOW; the notice board in the nave says it too) and who has the keys (KEYS; the
//              sexton, Orrin Pale, says it as well). All three = "planned".
//       IN     Night (dead of night, 21:00-05:00) by the lock, a live sermon (js/synod15.js: the Warden stands with the
//              deacon, the hymn comes down the floor), or Orrin's key (30 sovereigns, any hour).
//       TAKE   Six letters from the Held Cabinet (3 tumblers by the game's own lockpicking, Orrin's key, or force).
//       OUT    By the door or the coal-hatch. Delivering a letter to its person (Lyra, Kaelen, Hetty, Orla, Pim, Dessa) is
//              the payoff: a few short lines, standing, a little coin.
//  2. DEPOT THREE [PROPOSED] (the Consortium). The quarry depot has a door in its south-east corner (the Factor's counting
//     room, p16h_depot3), open from the night bell (22:00) to the morning one (06:00). Factor Vosk's ledgers: "Reconciliation
//     has not finished". The bore bites for 8 s in every 22 and covers sound; two guards, a clerk who can be paid, and a
//     safe (3 tumblers again, or the sledge). Take: the roster ledger (the persons without a roster number) and the lease
//     copy (Mossbrook's name, 404). Give them to Sergeant Vause, the Compact steward or Reeve Mossbrook.
//
//  BOTH: plan -> in -> take -> out; a heist page in the logbook that fills as you learn things; quiet / bribe-or-disguise /
//  loud (and the sermon window for the Chapel). Being seen = the existing law (reportCrime, the arrest panel, the watch-house)
//  and the haul is seized; being loud = the crime is reported but you may keep what you took if you get out. Nothing here
//  can lock you in: every inner passage is open, both maps have two ways out, the exit doors are never locked. The Rite,
//  the main quest and every story flag are never touched. Both close at the Rite or the Greening with one logbook line.
//
//  BALANCE (one table, B). SWITCH: Options -> Graphics & access -> "Heists" (default On, localStorage octave.heist16.v1).
//  Off = the original game: the doors stay shut, nobody asks, no wrapped behaviour does anything.
//  STATE: G.flags under p16h_ only, small validated integers (FLAGS). Guards and the new people are transient (rebuilt from the
//  flags when you walk in), never saved. Every invented fact is marked [PROPOSED]; every player-visible string is in TX.
//  ART: procedural stand-ins (canvas, cached once).
