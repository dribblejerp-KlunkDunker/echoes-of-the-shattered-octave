// ============================================================
//  kestrel16 — Phase 16 "New ground", team KESTREL: the Drift-Kestrel as a home base you can upgrade, with crew you recruit.
//
//  THE SHIP. After the escape (Part Three on) the Kestrel is two walkable maps, registered from this module the way
//  js/house13.js and js/parish.js register theirs (a buildAllMaps wrapper; nothing in maps.js or data.js is edited; no
//  entity is ever added to an old map's saved list):
//    p16k_kestrel_deck   outdoor: a 28-cell hull in a field of lit mist, rail all round (a low wall you see over), the wheel,
//                        the map table, the mast, lashed crates, the ladder over the rail, the companionway hatch
//    p16k_kestrel_below  indoor: tank room (west, the one-note hum) | mess and galley (the stair up, a cold stove) |
//                        bunk room (the bed) over the hold (stash chest, chandler's locker, the repair list, murmuring crates)
//  ROUTES IN (both always leave again by the same ladder; there is no way to be stuck aboard):
//    * Whisper-Grove: the mast-ladder at the south landing (the existing wg_ladder deco). Its use now offers "Climb up to the
//      deck", and, in Part Three only, the old "Climb, and go on to the Deep Woods" which runs the original event untouched.
//    * the Deep Woods camp: the Kestrel deco, once Tobiah has closed the number-two tank (flag tank_patched): a hatch in her flank.
//    * Before the escape the ship stays at the Oakhaven mast ("Nobody is aboard who will talk to you yet"): not boardable.
//  OPTIONAL HOP (new lift-tank + coda_done): the map table flies the Kestrel between the two moorings (4 hours).
//  THE BED (p16k_bed) rests like a house bed: 8 hours (6 with the lanterns), hp/voice/fatigue back (needs-aware, as doRest),
//  bleed/deaf/hushed/fear cleared, injuries mended only with proper bunks. Both map ids contain "kestrel", so js/night13.js
//  counts the ship as SAFE (NIGHT13.isSafePlace): no terror, ever.
//  THE STASH is the existing house strongbox (p.houseStorage, use house_chest), retitled while aboard: same chest as Cooper's Row.
//  THE TABLE opens the existing world-map panel (travel.js). Journeys begun at the table take their bonuses from the ship:
//    minutes: envelope patch x0.85 (rounded to 5 min, min 5);  ambush chance (travelRisk): x(1-0.35 the lookout) x(1-0.15 chart room).
//  COOKING aboard: a lit stove (upgrade) carries use p15_cook, so js/hearth15.js's "Cook something" works; TROPHIES: the rail
//  upgrade's six pegs hang hearth15's boss trophies (own flags p16k_rp0..5; a trophy hangs aboard or at home, never both).
//
//  THE UPGRADES (one table, UPG above; prices in sovereigns + existing items; the engineer takes a fifth off the gold):
//    envelope  60 + 3 Silver Proctor-Mesh + 1 Bell-Bronze Scrap   map-table journeys take 85% of the time        silk patch hung at the mast
//    lamps     50 + 1 Light-Glass Shard + 2 Scrap                  rest 6 h not 8; passage ambient +0.10         six glass lanterns glow
//    stove     45 + 4 Scrap                                        cooking aboard; Nell can bake                 cold stove becomes a lit one
//    rail      35 + 2 Scrap                                        six trophy pegs                               pegged board + pegs
//    bunks     40 + 2 Mesh + 1 Scrap                               rest also mends injuries                      four blanketed bunks
//    chart     70 + 1 Mesh + 1 Shard                               map-table ambush chance x0.85                 awning, wall charts, sextant
//    tank     140 + 6 Scrap + 4 Mesh + 2 Shard + 2 Governor-Gear   the two-mooring hop (needs the engineer, envelope, tank_patched)   a third, burnished tank
//  Materials are never out of reach: the chandler's locker in the hold sells Scrap 12, Mesh 18, Gear 30, Shard 55.
//
//  THE CREW [PROPOSED for Book One; the game's own text wins]. Tobiah Marsh (second engineer) is already in the game. The
//  lookout and the engineer are UNNAMED crew (author's ruling 2026-10-20: titles, not names; Mags and Pennick are Book Two
//  people and do not appear here). The engineer is the FIRST engineer Tobiah is second to, who has been below the whole
//  time. Their internal ids stay 'mags' and 'pennick' (CREW bits, p16k_seen bits, NPC ids p16k_mags / p16k_pennick) so
//  saves that recruited them still load. Nobody is recruited by force: each has a short beat in dialogue, a place aboard,
//  a daily line and one small effect.
//    lookout  (keeps her eye to the glass) part3+; pay 30 sovereigns for a new lens   ambush chance x0.65 on map-table journeys
//    engineer (dry, pessimist)          tank_patched and the envelope fitted          gold cost of every upgrade x0.80; builds the new tank
//    Nell     (the mill; only if pim_safe) the stove is fitted                         once a game day, one Hearth Bread
//    Hob      (the tanner; only if twins_named, i.e. he climbed) the lanterns fitted   once a game day, +35 condition to the readied weapon
//    (Pim Carder, with his mother, sits in the bunk room when pim_safe: the existing NPC, no effect.) Nobody who dies in the
//    story is ever aboard, and nobody here is story-bound: no flag the main quest reads is set or read for gating anything but
//    tank_patched, pim_safe, twins_named, part3, part4, coda_done (all set by the story, never by this module).
//
//  STATE: G.flags under p16k_ only, validated on every read (FLAGS): up (7 bits), crew (4), seen (6), moor 0-2, visits, loaf,
//  mend (game day + 1), rest, rp0..rp5. Anything else under the prefix is dropped on load; values are clamped to whole
//  numbers in range. Props, people and trophies are TRANSIENT entities rebuilt from the flags (furnish); the maps are built
//  deterministically so saved entity indexes line up. No markup is built from saves: every string is a constant (S()).
//  SWITCH: Options -> Graphics & access -> "Aboard the Drift-Kestrel" (default On; localStorage 'octave.kestrel16.v1').
//  Off = the game as it was: the ladder runs the original event, the Kestrel deco says what it said, no wrapped function
//  changes anything (and if you are aboard when it goes off you are put back on the ground).
//  ART: procedural stand-ins (canvas, painted once and cached). Every invented fact is marked [PROPOSED].
