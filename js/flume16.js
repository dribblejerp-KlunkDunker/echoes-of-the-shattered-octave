// ============================================================
//  flume16 — Phase 16 "New ground", team FLUME: "The Chlorophyll Flume".
//
//  A side area outside Oakhaven's east Hedge, before the Greening: the living aqueduct that carries a green river UPHILL.
//    * Three linked outdoor maps, registered from this module (never maps.js / data.js):
//        flume_road     The Flume Road: a path climbing beside the grown-wood channel (the height system: the path
//                       rises 2.4, the channel rises 3.6, so the water ends up above your head). The Wash is a cutting
//                       where the aqueduct over-pumps (the surge). A hollow pier under the Wash, opened by a rumour.
//        flume_landing  Stillwater Landing, the lower lock: a smugglers' wharf. Pellam Dree the lockkeeper sells the same
//                       news to six parties; Madge Tallow fences at a bad rate; Orrin Haft's raft is chained behind the lock.
//        flume_lowrings The Low Rings: Oakhaven's flooded lower quarter. Roofs and upper floors out of green water.
//    * THE SURGE. A clock runs while you are in these maps: quiet, then a telegraph (the Flume's held vowel climbs a fifth
//      and a rumble builds), then the surge (a wall of green fills the Wash; standing in it walks you back down the road and
//      slows you; two pockets in the cutting are out of the water), then the drain. No damage, ever: only fatigue.
//    * THE HELD VOWEL. A continuous low "ohh" (174 Hz, the Growth Anchor, through two vowel formants) synthesised on
//      Audio_'s one context, panned and filtered by SPATIAL toward the nearest channel cell, audible on all three maps.
//    * FOES. Briar-sprites (new, procedural art, five poses): small spore-fauna that strip leather and boots. The game does
//      not track armour condition, so each hit instead makes a small bleed (UPG.status.bleed, ticked here, never lethal)
//      and steals fatigue. Mire-drones (parish.js) in the Low Rings; hounds on the road. RINGING TIMBER: a blow near
//      grown wood rings like a bell: noise, and every hound within hearing turns to investigate.
//    * THE LOCK OF STILLWATER (side quest): Orrin Haft, a Timber Compact cutter, has forty iron-bough logs on a raft behind
//      the chained lower lock. Open the lock-wheel (lockpicking), or sing the Root note at it, or buy the key from Pellam.
//    * ACCESS: a door in Oakhaven's east Hedge beside the Flume's exit (a world-map waypoint too). After the Greening the
//      door is a hedge and the waypoints go; an open quest writes one closing journal line. Nothing blocks the main quest.
//
//  GAMEPLAY EFFECTS (the one table, B below):
//    surge cycle        quiet 10 s, telegraph 4 s, surge 8 s, drain 2.5 s           Wash cutting, x 24..39
//    surge in the Wash  push 3.4 u/s downhill (west), speed x0.45, fatigue -7/s     no HP loss, pockets are safe
//    briar-sprite       hp 7, 1-2 damage, bleed 4 s (0.5 hp/s, floor 1 hp), fatigue -6 per hit
//    ringing timber     +2.6 noise per blow near grown wood, wakes hounds within 18
//    fence              buys at 50 % of the shop-sell price
//    rumour             12 sovereigns; opens the hollow pier (flag p16f_tip)
//    lock quest         40 sovereigns, 60 xp, Hedge standing +3, two honey
//
//  STATE: G.flags under p16f_ only, small validated integers (see FLAGS): q quest stage (0 none, 1 taken, 2 done, 3 closed
//  by the Greening), tip (the rumour was bought), lock (the lock-wheel was opened), key (the key was bought), seen
//  (a bitmask of the maps visited), gift (a gift left in the loft), done (the reward was paid), met (the keeper has been spoken to). Anything else under the prefix is dropped on load. The surge clock, the sprite
//  bleed and the wave props are transient (never saved); the three maps are built deterministically so saved entity
//  indexes line up (baseCount set once, nothing is inserted into an old map's list).
//  SWITCHES: Options -> Graphics & access -> "Flume surges" (default on; off = the Wash never floods, the note stays
//  level) and the GFX flag flumeGlow ("Flume glow": the green light of the water; per-frame, so off in Low and Original).
//  Every invented name, place and fact is marked [PROPOSED]; all player-visible text is in TX, registered through S().
//  Art: procedural stand-ins (canvas painting, cached once). Security: no markup is built from saves or flags.
