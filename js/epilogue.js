//
//  1. Choice-dependent Kaelen / Lyra epilogues, appended to the two Book One endings
//     ("Grab the Line" in game.js ending(), "Not Yet" in grove.js bookOneEnd()). The
//     existing paragraphs, title and buttons are never touched; the new paragraphs are
//     inserted just above the closing "Here ends ..." line.
//  2. Lore teasers for the Organum, the Iron Peaks and the Rift: nine bookshelf volumes
//     on shelves that were duplicates or dead furniture, a Lore Codex section that fills
//     in as they are read, and margin notes on the continent map.
//
//  Switch: UPG.storyEpilogues (default on). Off = the original endings, shelves, codex and map.
//  Memory: only G.flags entries starting p6e_ with boolean values (p6e_ride_k, p6e_rd_o1 ...).
//  Safety: every sentence shown comes from the constant tables below and goes in through
//  textContent. Flag values only choose between those tables; they are never printed.
//  Everything marked [PROPOSED] is invented beyond LORE_P6.md and needs the author's eye.
