// ============================================================
//  grove31 — Release road R5b: the Moot-house's gallery and cellar, and the Bell Yard and Ashlane, in Whisper-Grove.
//
//    * THE MOOT-HOUSE (Book One ch. 14): the plaza's fourth side. Libraries26 built its hall as a library; this adds a stair
//      up to the GALLERY, where Sable first saw a proctor ("a grey figure in oilcloth at the edge of the mist ... watching
//      the plaza for a full hour"), and the room she made for herself in the MUNIMENT STORE: lamp, desk, ruler, nib and
//      blotter. And a stair down to the CELLAR, where Corwin Aye's barrel "has not leaked in nineteen years" (ch. 16).
//    * THE BELL YARD AND ASHLANE (one map, off the Sunken Court's west side): the joiners' and coopers' streets.
//      Shutters latched, streets swept, a window-box of dead flowers on Bell Yard (ch. 15), the lamps the lamplighter lights
//      with no oil in them, carts in the carters' yard with their shafts up, and the Office's proctors walking it (ch. 14).
//      Halder Wick's house (joiner, of the Bell Yard) and Ivo Renn's (cooper, of Ashlane) open: meals left on the tables.
//    * "THE BELL YARD ROLL" [PROPOSED: the quest; the names are canon or from the library's books]: the name-boards on
//      the doors. Write each household into your ledger.
//    * "DO NOT COMFORT YOURSELF IN THE MARGIN" (ch. 14): the twice-taken man sits against a wall in Ashlane doing nothing
//      at all. Tell Sable you found him, and she gives you her margin entry and the Veil's three rules.
//
//  Canon note for the owner: Book One makes Bettis Renn Ivo's wife (38, "she asked to go second"); the game's Malting has
//  a man called Bettis Renn on the bench. The Renn house here names only Ivo, and the conflict is left for a ruling.
//  The new maps are always built (a save may stand in one); nothing draws on the random stream. Both quests close with a
//  logbook line when the Kestrel leaves Whisper-Grove (Part Four).
