// ============================================================
//  rope45 — Grab the Line, played (Book One ch. 12; ROADMAP R9 item 2).
//
//  The Note has stopped and the Drift-Kestrel has come down over the North Gate (js/greening44.js). The book tells this
//  chapter from Vane's deck; the traveller arrives with the four hundred in the mud, so the scene starts there:
//    1  THE LINE. Mags puts the line over at forty feet. The town does not rush it: Hetty on the mounting-block making a
//       queue with her forearms, Bettany pulling the children forward, Rooke doing triage with two lamps and no table.
//       Mags, at the drum, jerks her head at you, once [PROPOSED]: go up and work the winch with her, or stay at the foot
//       of the line with the Governor and load.
//    2  THE DRUM (on deck). Haul on the beat with Mags, four at a time, knots at four feet. Vane counts them onto the
//       deck: four, eight, eleven ("Captain—" "I can count."), thirteen, fifteen. The ship is settling; the oaks are not.
//    1g THE FOOT OF THE LINE (in the mud) [PROPOSED]. Put people on the knots with Aldric Vance, who has been doing it
//       for twenty minutes; hear the count from above.
//    3  EIGHTEEN. The hounds come into the canopy (a woman singing about lambs and dusk, a man's tenor missing a high
//       note, a child laughing). The jitter drops onto the line and goes through the old man at the bottom; his hands
//       stay on the knot, then fall (canon, whatever you do). On deck it comes over the rail: you can hold it there, but
//       Kaelen comes over the port rail and takes it out of the air with his glass fist either way (canon). "Get them up!" Three up.
//       Twenty-one.
//    4  LYRA, AND THE LAST LOAD. Lyra comes up with the last four before the last (with Lissa Merrow roped under the arms
//       and Tobiah with his charts: the books-check fix N1, so that ch. 13 holds), and cannot make a sound. "I know. I
//       know. They're coming." From the foot of the line, Aldric puts your hands on that load's knot, wordless [PROPOSED]. The last load is five:
//       the dye-works woman, two carters, a woman screaming a name, and the Governor at the bottom. "Take her up."
//    5  THE COUNT. The ship goes sideways, the rope snags in a crown, the drum starts to come out of the deck, and Vane
//       counts one to ten, as the book has it. Your only input is where you look. Hold on to the drum at ten and the Echo
//       plays [PROPOSED, GDD 4.9]: the drum tears out, the Kestrel goes into the crown, the Tide-Weaver: "I have watched you
//       choose this four hundred and eleven times." You are back at nine. "Do it," says Kaelen. Vane cuts.
//    6  AFTER. She comes up like a cork. Three hundred and eighty people in the mud, waving. Six feet of cut rope hanging
//       from the drum; nobody coils it. Then game.js's end card, told as you played it.
//    7  done.
//  The deck is js/kestrel16.js's map; it is allowed aboard during stages 2–6 (aboard()), and its ladder and hatch are shut
//  until the cut. Figures are transient and staged again on load. The Greening's clock stands still for the scene.
