// ============================================================
//  tobin — Phase 6 (story reactivity): the twelve pages of Cantor Tobin Ashgrove's journal.
//
//  Tobin was Oakhaven's Cantor, Lyra's father, taken in the spring of 417 at the Pellow farm, before the Hedge was planted
//  (Book One's manuscript). The game already holds his Parish Register (spring 417), his Tuning-Blade and the slate
//  under the cairn. This module scatters twelve loose pages of an older, quieter book, spring 412 to the spring of
//  417, as findable items:
//    * each page is a transient item entity appended to its map when the map is entered (never saved, never
//      solid, never in a doorway), so saved entity indexes never shift and a page never respawns;
//    * collecting one sets G.flags.p6t_page_<n> = true (the only saved state) and opens the page as a held
//      document (READING.SOURCES, style 'parch', kind 'Journal');
//    * the logbook gains a "Tobin's Journal (n/12)" section that lists the found pages in order and re-reads them;
//    * finding all twelve gives a small, non-breaking reward once (p6t_done): experience, a title and a keepsake.
//
//  Security: no markup is built from saves or flags. Page text comes from the constant table below; flags are only
//  ever compared with === true. Switch: UPG.tobinPages (default on). Off = no pages, no section, original logbook.
//
//  Sprites are procedural stand-ins (a folded sheet painted into a Uint32Array, cached once).
//  Anything marked [PROPOSED] is invention beyond LORE_P6.md and the game's own text.

  // Voice: a Cantor's - tending notes, dry humour as armour, short concrete sentences, the Hush only ever reported.
  // [PROPOSED] throughout: the dates, the people around him and the small events are inventions that stay inside
  // the game's facts (Cascade famine, Essa lost at the sluice, the lease, the blade of 415, the first silences, the
  // hounds at the orchards, the bells taken for the bore's teeth and the bore in 417, the register, the cairn). Per
  // the manuscript he is taken at the Pellow farm in the spring of 417: the Hedge is only an idea in these pages.
  // [PROPOSED] why the pages lie where they do is never explained; the found-lines only say where a sheet was tucked.
