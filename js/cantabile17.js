// ============================================================
//  cantabile17 — Phase 17 "Beyond Book One", team CANTABILE: "A trip to Port Cantabile".   AN EXTRA, SET AFTER BOOK ONE.
//
//  Reached only from the Extras menu (js/extras17.js): EXTRAS17.register({ id: 'cantabile', start, ... }) below. It runs in the
//  extra's own session, so the Book One save is never touched; this module also never writes localStorage and never sets a flag
//  outside p17c_. It builds five maps, registered from this module the way js/flume16.js does (never maps.js / data.js), and
//  nothing in Book One leads to any of them.
//
//  WHEN: Memoryday, the seventh of Ashfall, 419 [PROPOSED: a day inside Book Two's first week, which the Kestrel spends on the
//  Harbour's bench. Book Two's own scenes (the Bitter Nancy, the Stair, the counting-house, the dive, the Mole-head) are not
//  staged and not contradicted: the visit is an errand ashore on a day that goes on around them. Ashfall is late autumn: the
//  winter look is called with no snow, no falling snow and a faint cold grade, and breath only.]
//  WHERE (Vol IV "Book Three: the Rust Coast", which supersedes Vol II: a CLIFF HARBOUR, not a rope-bridge town):
//    cantabile_harbour  one big relief map. The Long Mole runs east out of the Lantern Yard with the derrick, the Mole-bell and
//                       the mast-tower (the Kestrel hangs from it) at its head. The Salt Stair is six wet flights cut up the
//                       cliff behind the Yard, forty-one steps each (the Phase 2 height system: every flight is a real slope
//                       that climbs 1.8, six landings at 0.4 + 1.8 n, so the top is 11.2 above the quay), with a landing at the
//                       head of each flight and a lantern on a hook. At the top, a yard of wet flags and the counting-house
//                       (square stone, slate roof, iron shutters, a brass sun-disc over the door): CLOSED, a door like any other.
//    cantabile_office   the Harbour office (Teague, the board, the Articles)
//    cantabile_chandler the chandler on the third landing (diving-helm in the window that was new in his grandfather's time)
//    cantabile_widow    a room cut into the rock on the fourth landing (the widow with the bottle she has not opened in 3 years)
//    cantabile_cay      Driftwood Cay: the burying-ground, children in earth, a small bell on an iron hook at every grave
//  WHAT TO DO (a small errand chain, never required beyond the first rung up to the Kestrel; you may leave at any time):
//    1. PAY THE DUES. Six sovereigns, into the Harbour-Queen's own hand, AT THE SLACK. She asks the greeting, "What's she
//       singing?", and the answer is the key the reef is singing right now. THE REEF-PITCH PUZZLE: the reef sings six keys up
//       from a low E (E, F-sharp, G, A, B, C), one to the tide-hour, and drops back. The board says the slack is "the key before
//       the turning"; a pilot's rhyme (Captain Teel) and Auld Bessa give the order; the water tells you too (the boats hang
//       slack on their ropes at the slack, and swing together at the turning). Say the right key AT the slack.
//    2. THE GAUGE-VALVE (Pennick's list). The chandler sells to hulls with the Harbour's receipt.
//    3. THE BOTTLE. Marrin Tace, fourth landing, holds a vox-bottle she has not opened in three years and will not sell. She asks
//       you to carry it, unopened, to the Harbour-Queen and ask for the bell. The Mole-bell is the town's grammar of grief:
//       one stroke for each soul that goes into the water, then silence so the harbour can count. Or sell it to the Office's
//       receiving clerk at six sovereigns and a stamped receipt (the administrative horror; the choice is yours).
//    Small things: lift a salvage crate under the Sixteenth Article; hang a grave-bell on a bare hook on the Cay; read the
//    Articles; sit on the fifth landing; the bell for "someone nobody can name" (the Mole-bell rings once, unasked, at some
//    point on your walk, and the whole Yard stops and counts).
//  The Hush is never shown, a "quiet" is only ever the rule about bottles ("never on a ship; never take the stopper out").
//
//  BALANCE (the one table, B): purse 20 (Vane's money, topped up to at least that); dues 6; valve 5; a grave-bell 1; salvage
//  crate +8 (a fifth to the Harbour); the clerk's offer 6; rewards: dues 20 xp, valve 15, the bottle rung 45 xp + 6 sovereigns
//  (Mistress Tace insists) + a pilot's whistle, a bell hung 10, salvage 5. The reef clock: six keys of 24 s (144 s a cycle),
//  frozen while a dialogue or panel is open; the slack (B) lasts 24 s; the first slack comes about 72 s after arrival.
//  There is no combat, no hunger rule beyond the game's own, and no way to be stuck: every map has its doors, the mast-tower
//  is always climbable (not with the bottle: "never on a ship") and you can leave whether or not the errands are done.
//
//  STATE: G.flags under p17c_ only, small validated integers (FLAGS). Everything else is transient. The five maps build
//  deterministically so saved entity indexes line up (baseCount set once; nothing is inserted into an old list).
//  Every invented name, place and fact is marked [PROPOSED]; every player-visible string is in TX, registered through S().
//  ART: procedural stand-ins (canvas painting, cached once). Security: no markup is built from saves or flags.
