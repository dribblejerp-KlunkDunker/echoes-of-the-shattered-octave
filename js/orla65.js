//  orla65 — Orla Hale: the harvest home (ROADMAP R9 item 17; Story Brainstorm #17; Book One ch. 3 ll. 1005–1057, ch. 6
//  ll. 1955–1983, ch. 11 ll. 3462–3492).
//
//    * AFTER THE BOOTS (canon, ch. 6, spoken to whoever brought them): "He sang it. Didn't he." / "I heard him. Clear
//      across the square." / "Was he any good?" You may tell her the truth, as Lyra did ("He couldn't hold the fourth
//      line"), or not. Either way: "Never could. His da couldn't either. Forty years I tried to teach the pair of them."
//      "I heard it again, after ... It had his voice. It didn't have him." And Lyra will sing her down, proper, before the
//      fire. All the lines. Even the fourth.
//    * [PROPOSED] SHE TEACHES YOU THE LAST SHEAF, one lesson a day, from the chair, in the voice like a rusty gate: the first
//      two lines (the only words the book gives: "Oh, the last sheaf's in and the barley's high, and the swallows are low
//      in the harvest sky"; the rest are taught, never written), then the third line, then the fourth, the narrowest
//      band. Each time, the shutters first and a rag in the cracks, or sing with them open and let the Hedge hear it.
//    * The song is a learnable Song [PROPOSED stats: loud, calls hounds]; knowing it sets g44_knows_sheaf, so in the
//      Greening (js/greening44.js) you sing the second voice with Lyra at Orla's tree, as cutting the Last Sheaf with
//      Harrow already does (js/festivals12.js). Orla still stops breathing around the sixth line, whatever you do (canon).
//  Inside the Hedge, before the Greening only. Flags: p65_told (1 truth, 2 kind), p65_day (the day of the last step),
//  p65_lesson (0..3), p65_loud (lessons sung with the shutters open).

"His da couldn\'t either. Forty years I tried to teach the pair of them." A breath. "I heard it again, after. Out past the Hedge. Somebody singing it back. It had his voice.
