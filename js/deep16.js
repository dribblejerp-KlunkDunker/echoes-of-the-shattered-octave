// ============================================================
//  deep16 — Phase 16 (new ground), team DEEP: THE LOWER PLAZAS, the drowned administrative quarter under Whisper-Grove.
//
//  After the Greening (part3 and later) a stair goes on down under the deep pool at the south-west of the Sunken Court
//  [PROPOSED]. Below is the Synod's "restorative administration" as it was left: a notice hall, a filing hall, the clerks'
//  room, a stair down past the 409 water mark, a relief convoy's depot, a register office and a room of things nobody
//  came back for [PROPOSED, all of it]. The Unstrung are alive above; down here there is only what was left. Few foes,
//  and those far back. The dread is light, silence, and what the records say.
//
//  THE MECHANIC (new: before this, deep water could only be swum at the surface, js/upgrades.js tickSwim):
//    * The whole map is under water. You swim in three dimensions: W/A/S/D as on land (slower, with a glide), Space rises,
//      X or Ctrl sinks, and swimming forward while looking up or down climbs or dives (so touch and controller players
//      swim with the look alone). The eye height is a swim depth z between the floor and the vault (Engine.cam.z on a
//      relief map: the Phase 2 height system draws it). Low furniture (the counter, the filing stacks) can be swum over.
//    * Breath: a meter on the HUD (role=meter, labelled, with captions). It drains while you are under; it refills only
//      where air is caught under a vault (a silver ceiling and a trembling skin of light) and your head is up in it.
//      Warnings at half, a quarter and a tenth; when it is empty you get a grace of B.GRACE seconds and only then the
//      water starts to hurt, ramping slowly. Never instantly lethal: from a full breath the first damage is
//      B.BREATH + B.GRACE seconds away, and death some seconds after that.
//    * Down here Songs do not carry (the Hush rule fits: silence), except a murmur. Weapons come slow.
//    * The view: a full-screen under-water post pass (green-lilac depth fog, slow caustic light on floor and walls,
//      a little drifting silt, a slow wobble). Off above water and when your head is in a pocket of air. Sound goes
//      through the master low-pass (Audio_.muffle, as house13 does: a floor, never fighting fp-feel) and the recorded
//      music is ducked; the procedural Extended score goes through the master and so through the low-pass too.
//
//  GAMEPLAY TABLE (the one table; B below):
//    breath                      B.BREATH s (+0.1 s per Endurance point over 40, at most +6)      drain 1/s, x1.6 sprinting, x0.75 still
//    refill                      B.REFILL per s with your head in a pocket of air
//    warnings                    50 %, 25 %, 10 % (message + caption), empty: message + caption, then B.GRACE s grace
//    drowning                    B.DROWN_DPS hp/s rising to B.DROWN_MAX over B.DROWN_RAMP s; only after the grace
//    swim speed                  B.SWIM u/s (B.SPRINT with Shift; walking on land is about 2.6-3.3); rise/sink B.RISE u/s
//    weapons                     cooldown x B.WEAPON_SLOW under water
//    Songs                       only the murmur, under water; the others do nothing and cost nothing
//    foes                        three Drowned Hollows, all in the deep rooms, all guards (they see you only close up)
//    reward                      the relief register: 9 names into the Ledger, a journal line, B.XP xp; Sable has a topic about it
//
//  ROUTE: dive point (E at the pool, 15.5 34.5 in the Sunken Court) -> Well Three (air) -> notice hall -> filing hall (air in
//  the fallen vault) -> clerks' room (air) -> the stair down -> the depot, whose lamp-shaft (air) is the second way out ->
//  the register office (air; the register) -> the returns room. Every air pocket is in reach of the next with margin
//  (DEEP16.budget(), tested); two ways up (Well Three, the lamp-shaft), never locked.
//
//  STATE: G.flags under p16d_ only, validated on every read (FLAGS): reg (the register taken), air (the last air pocket,
//  0-5), seen (room bits), dives (0-99), j (journal stage). Swimming state, breath and depth are TRANSIENT: a save made
//  under water loads you safely at the last air pocket you breathed at, head up, breath full.
//  SWITCHES: Options -> Graphics & access -> "The Lower Plazas" (content; default On; localStorage 'octave.deep16.v1'; Off
//  = no dive point, the original Court) and "Underwater view" (GFX.deepView; in GFX.FX so Original/plain turn it off; in
//  LOW_OFF, per-frame). With the view off, the map's own fog still makes it murky.
//  ACCESS: Reduce motion = no wobble, slow caustics, still silt, no sway; No flashes = static caustics, no meter pulse;
//  captions for every sound cue; the meter has role=meter and a text label. Cinematic: this pass adds no bloom and no
//  vignette when cinema14's grade is on, so nothing doubles.
//  Procedural stand-ins: every texture and sprite is painted here once and cached. Nothing draws from Math.random.
