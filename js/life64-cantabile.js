// ============================================================
//  life64-cantabile — Port Cantabile's Lantern Yard and the Long Mole keep the hours (ROADMAP R10 wave 3; engine
//  js/life60.js). The harbour is the "A trip to Port Cantabile" extra's map (js/cantabile17.js), set after Book One.
//
//  Canon (World Bible Vol IV, "Book Three: the Rust Coast"; Book Two ch. 8–14): a cliff harbour; the trade is salvage,
//  pilotage and vox-bottles; the Free Captains and their Articles; the carillon rigging on forty boats; the Mole-bell rung
//  once for each soul that goes into the water, and then the harbour counts; Hesper's four houses on the Yard, with small
//  boots by the doors. Nothing here is still.
//  [PROPOSED] Every person below (roles only, no names): net-menders and a fishwife, two salvage divers bringing crates up
//  the Yard steps to the Harbour office (Article the Sixteenth, the Harbour's fifth), a rope-coiler laying the Harbour's way,
//  Hesper's children and the eldest girl at the washing line, a pilot waiting on the Mole for a fare, two Free Captains
//  arguing, a boy sluicing the Mole, a caulker, a sail-mender, a water-carrier, the Harbour's reader at noon, the
//  lamplighter at dusk, the night watch on the Mole-head and a man fishing off the Mole after dark. Grown-ups go home up
//  the Salt Stair; the children go in at Hesper's doors.
//  They keep to the quay (flags and Mole, never the water or the cliff), and when the Mole-bell rings they stop where they
//  are and say nothing until the harbour has counted (js/cantabile17.js T.count).
//  The Flambeaux at the counting-house and the Book Two scenes are not staged, as in the extra.
