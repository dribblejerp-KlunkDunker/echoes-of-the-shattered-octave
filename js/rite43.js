// ============================================================
//  rite43 — the Rite of Pure Unison, from procession to pumps (Book One ch. 9–10; ROADMAP R9 item 3).
//
//  Replaces "take the shaft, seat the coil, kill two golems" with the chapters as the book has them. The traveller is a
//  stranger: the needle, the coil and the speaking-tube are Kaelen's hands, and the Rite ends the way it ends. What the
//  player does is what a stranger beside them could do:
//    1  THE PROCESSION (ch. 9). The point of no return moves from the shaft gate to Lyra's door: when the column forms
//       there with the coil in Kaelen's toolbag, you walk with it up the main road to the headframe under the Pure Note,
//       and the town hums the Root note under it, "exactly a hand's width of voice". N hums with them. A loud Song turns
//       a Flambeau's stave toward you; twice, and a Legionnaire walks you at the back.
//    2  THE VAULT. The cage, four hundred feet; the pumps, where Lyra breathes the Root note into a Hollow's wrist.
//    3  THE NEEDLE. Kaelen's hands shake. "Closer, Engineer. I must be able to see." You stand between the Inquisitor's
//       eye and the glass hand for the seconds it takes to put the wire through skin and not through her voice. Then
//       "Speak, daughter." "I. Am. Fortunate." In the book he never sees: if he does here, that is an Echo (GDD 4.9),
//       shown grey, and you are back on the boards with the needle still in Kaelen's fingers.
//    4  THE HOLD. "Head at one span!" Lyra sings 174. Kaelen goes to the drum on the collar walk: eight bolts; he
//       promised himself forty seconds and took fifty-one, and nobody stopped him. You hum beside the stool, and the
//       Factor's green lenses, which see pitch as colour, stay on you; if they settle on the plate, that is an Echo and
//       the Hold again. Then he seats the coil, the lock throws, the crown of glass teeth snaps, and Crane shouts
//       for the hold. "LYRA! SING IT DOWN!": Hold the Pitch on the falling fifth, with her, until the Root lets go.
//    5  THE GOLEMS. "The Consortium kept four at the casing, and the Factor turned them all at once." Two come; two are
//       stopped by "Enough." Kaelen knees one and drinks the other, and the tideline is four fingers after.
//    6  THE TUBE AND THE PUMPS. The three-note purge alarm; Aldric's sixty seconds, "Forty-one. Forty." Twelve men on
//       the pumps, the cage holds eight, four go up with Tobiah and the sisters, eight are left. Your sixty seconds are
//       spent on names: a hand on a Hollow's wrist stops him for the length of a breath, and in that breath he says who
//       he was. Then forty thousand gallons, and the Root drinks, and screams, and cracks, and grows: the Greening.
//  Missing any of it changes lines, never fails a quest, and never changes what happens in the book. Flags: r43 (stage),
//  r43_hum, r43_you_hum, r43_strikes, r43_marched, r43_echoes, r43_fifth, r43_names, r43_palm, rooke_drops; the eight left are
//  in the ledger. Text: TX, collected in TEXTS for the French (tools/i18n/p43-rite.tsv).
