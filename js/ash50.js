//  ash50 — Ash in the Hold, played (Book One ch. 13; ROADMAP R9 item 8).
//
//  The Part Two ending's "Begin Part Three" button used to go straight to the startPart3 text card. Now it offers one
//  night aboard the Drift-Kestrel first (or sleep through it, and the card plays as before). Two new maps, a deck at
//  night over the Reach and the hold, built the way js/kestrel16.js builds hers:
//    1  THE NIGHT. Twenty-one aboard. Bettany's field hospital under the staysail: bring water from the cask, a tonic,
//       or hum the tending note (if you have it). Hetty counts the nine children aloud. Lyra at the stern in Vane's
//       coat: the second time, bring her the slate. YOU SAID DO IT. Nothing you can say helps; that is the beat.
//       Below, at the third crate, the Root through Kaelen's glass, still holding with a hole in it. Vane comes down
//       with a bottle and confesses if you made him hear the crates (vane_told), or stays on the ladder if not.
//       "You didn't have to say it." / "I know. That's why I said it."
//    2  THE FOURTH HOUR. Pennick screams. Hob Wendle has rooted into the deck. "I'm sorry about your ship, Captain."
//       Lyra has no voice; Bettany hums the tending note, badly, in the Narrow (and you may hum it with her). They cut
//       him out and put him over the side with four planks and five feet of beam. Vane says the words.
//    3  THE SEAMS [PROPOSED as play]: crawl the deck with Pennick and a lamp before first light, prising up every seam
//       that shows green. Miss one, and in Part Three the Kestrel's hold has a new pale plank where it was cut out
//       (cosmetic; the book's Pennick finds none).
//    4  FIRST LIGHT. The Church's firebreak ring burning in the green, eight hundred feet down. Tobiah Marsh: "I saw
//       what you put in the port." Tell him why, or say nothing. If you tell him and he still has his charts, he
//       gives them to you here, as in the book. "It was a beautiful Sequence, sir."
//    5  THE CALLING-SONG from four miles back, in Lyra's whole voice. Mags reaches for the axe.
//    6  THE BEAM. Kaelen writes 3½ and the names on the beam over the third crate; you can add the rest of yours.
//       If you left his old coat on the hut's step (js/governor46.js), he is wearing it [PROPOSED].
//  Then startPart3 runs, its card shortened to what the night did not show (js/grove.js asks ASH50).
//  Figures and seams are transient, staged from the flags. Flags: p50 (stage), p50_do (beats, bits), p50_w (the
//  wounded tended, bits), p50_sm (seams found, bits), p50_t (seconds of the search), p50_miss, p50_tob, p50_names.
